       "[\"Stormwater management is one of the greatest challenges in the modern urban environment. Doing it well – in a way which respects the natural environment and responds to its constraints – allows to address a multitude of other issues: social (creating amenity space, rebuilding connections between people and nature and improving the living environment), economical (increasing the land value, reducing development and maintenance costs), environmental (ecological corridors, biodiversity, mitigating heath island effects)… Urban designers have got an array of tools to use in order to integrate natural water management into city projects. The aim of this article is, using a number of case study projects in Villeneuve-la-Garenne, to present some of the most commonly used, efficient and simple to implement solutions which can be used to integrate NBS (Nature Based Solutions) into the stormwater management of a city at an individual project scale. The case studies will also provide a starting point for a discussion on the typical obstacles faced by urban designers when trying to implement them. Endorsed by numerous publications, encouraged by positive feedback and backed up by recent modifications in the legislation, sustainable water management has become more and more popular. However, some preconceptions still exist, mainly in regards to their efficiency, cost and maintenance. In order to overcome those it is essential to understand that, when applying the sustainable stormwater management techniques the designer's role is not simply to deal with the water but to design a stormwater management system perfectly integrated into public realm, to infiltrate light rain on site and to promote multifunctionality of public (and private) spaces.\",\n",
       " 'Wine producers face several challenges regarding climate change, which will affect this industry both in the present and the future. Vulnerability assessments are at the forefront of current climate research, therefore, the present paper has two main aims. First, to assess two components of climate vulnerability regarding the Szekszárd wine region, Hungary; second, to collect and analyze adaptation farming techniques in terms of environmental sustainability aspects. Exposure analyses revealed that the study area will face several challenges regarding intensive drought periods in the future. Sensitivity indicators show the climate-related characteristics of the most popular grapevines and their relatively high level of susceptibility regarding changing climatic patterns. Since both external and intrinsic factors of vulnerability show deteriorating trends, the development of adaptation actions is needed. Adaptation interventions often provide unsustainable solutions or entail maladaptation issues, therefore, an environmental-focused sustainability assessment of collected interventions was performed to avoid long-term negative path dependencies. The applied evaluation methodology pointed out that nature-based adaptation actions are preferred in comparison to using additional machines or resource-intensive solutions. This study can fill the scientific gap by analyzing this wine region for the first time, via performing an ex-ante lock-in analysis of available and widely used adaptation interventions in the viticulture sector. © 2021 by the author.

       " \"Terrestrial ecosystems are the core components of the biosphere, supporting human life, production and social and economic activities. With the development of human civilization and the progress of science and technology, the continued expanding resources utilization in terms of scale and intensity has caused environmental problems, including global climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental pollution, resource depletion and ecosystem degradation, which threaten the sustainable development of our society. The public expects ecological research providing scientific theories and systematic solutions for the utilization and protection of ecosystems at the continental and global scale, and the maintenance of sustainable development of human society as well. This study aimed to serve the ecological civilization construction in China, ecological security pattern construction, regional ecological and environmental governance, and the development of macrosystem ecology. We reviewed the effectiveness and experience of regional ecological and environmental governance in China, analyzed the scientific requirements and the characteristics of the times of China's eco-civilization construction towards large-scale ecological research, and proposed using a new philosophy, i.e., nature-based macroecosystem approach, to improve the ecological and environmental governance and ecological security pattern construction at the regional scale. Based on the above-mentioned expounding, we discussed the strategic plan, technical approaches and technological support system of large-scale ecological security pattern construction and ecological and environmental governance in China. This review could provide theoretical references for safe, healthy and beautiful land spatial construction and the progress of eco-civilization of China. © 2021, Science Press.

       " '(Despite a growing recognition of the importance of designing, rehabilitating, and maintaining green infrastructure to provide essential ecosystem services and adapt to climate change, many decision makers in sub-Saharan Africa continue to favour engineered solutions and short term economic growth at the expense of natural landscapes and longer term sustainability agendas. Existing green infrastructure is typically maintained in more affluent suburbs, inadvertently perpetuating historic inequalities. This is in part because there remains a lack of fine-grained, comparative evidence on the barriers and enablers to mainstreaming green infrastructure in peri-urban areas. Here, we developed an analytical framework based on a review of 155 studies, screened to include 29 studies in 24 countries. Results suggest eight overarching categories of interconnected barriers to green infrastructure in peri-urban areas. Using a combinatorial mixed method approach, we then surveyed households in nine settlements in drought-prone Windhoek (n=330) and seven settlements in flood-prone Dar es Salaam (n=502) and conducted key informant interviews (n=118). Peri-urban residents in Windhoek and Dar es Salaam indicated 18 forms of green infrastructure and 47 derived ecosystem services. The most frequently reported barriers were financial (40.8%), legal and institutional barriers (35.8%) followed by land use change and spatial trade-offs (33%) and finally ecosystem disservices (30.6%). The most significant barriers in Dar es Salaam were legal and institutional (22.7%) and in Windhoek were land use change and spatial trade-offs (24.4%). At the household level, the principal barrier was financial; at community and municipal levels the main barriers were related to design, performance, and maintenance; while at the national level, the main barriers were legal and institutional. Embracing institutional cultures of adaptive policymaking, equitable partnerships, co-designing futures, integrated landscape management and experimental innovation have potential to scale long term maintenance for urban green infrastructure and foster agency, creativity and more transformative relationships and outcomes.)',\n",
       " 'The response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise during the twenty-first century remains uncertain. Global-scale projections suggest that between 20 and 90 per cent (for low and high sea-level rise scenarios, respectively) of the present-day coastal wetland area will be lost, which will in turn result in the loss of biodiversity and highly valued ecosystem services1–3. These projections do not necessarily take into account all essential geomorphological4–7 and socio-economic system feedbacks8. Here we present an integrated global modelling approach that considers both the ability of coastal wetlands to build up vertically by sediment accretion, and the accommodation space, namely, the vertical and lateral space available for fine sediments to accumulate and be colonized by wetland vegetation. We use this approach to assess global-scale changes in coastal wetland area in response to global sea-level rise and anthropogenic coastal occupation during the twenty-first century. On the basis of our simulations, we find that, globally, rather than losses, wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area are possible, if more than 37 per cent (our upper estimate for current accommodation space) of coastal wetlands have sufficient accommodation space, and sediment supply remains at present levels. In contrast to previous studies1–3, we project that until 2100, the loss of global coastal wetland area will range between 0 and 30 per cent, assuming no further accommodation space in addition to current levels. Our simulations suggest that the resilience of global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability of accommodation space, which is strongly influenced by the building of anthropogenic infrastructure in the coastal zone and such infrastructure is expected to change over the twenty-first century. Rather than being an inevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicate that large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, if sufficient additional accommodation space can be created through careful nature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.',\n",
       " 'Living shorelines are nature-based solutions to coastal erosion that can be constructed as salt marshes with fringing oyster reefs. Each of these habitats can decrease the potential for eutrophication through increased nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification. However, the development of N cycling over time has not been studied in living shorelines. This research measured denitrification rates in a chronosequence of living shorelines spanning 0–20 years in age in Bogue Sound, NC. Analyses were conducted seasonally from summer 2014 to spring 2015 along an elevation transect through the salt marsh, oyster reef, and adjacent sandflat at all sites. Gas fluxes (N2 and O2) from sediment core incubations were measured with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS) to assess denitrification and sediment oxygen demand. Fluxes of dissolved nutrients and the greenhouse gas N2O were measured. Sediment properties, inundation frequency, oyster filtration rates, and marsh grass stem density were also quantified. There was no significant difference in denitrification rates among habitats. N removal consistently increased from the 0- to 7-year-old sites. Denitrification efficiency was always greater than 50% and positive N2O fluxes were negligible. Our results suggest that living shorelines increase net N removal within a relatively short time period following construction, without introducing deleterious greenhouse gas emissions. This demonstrates that living shorelines can play an important role in estuarine N cycling and management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Current and future climate-related coastal impacts such as catastrophic and repetitive flooding, hurricane intensity, and sea level rise necessitate a new approach to developing and managing coastal infrastructure. Traditional \"hard\" or \"grey\" engineering solutions are proving both expensive and inflexible in the face of a rapidly changing coastal environment. Hybrid solutions that incorporate natural, nature-based, structural, and non-structural features may better achieve a broad set of goals such as ecological enhancement, long-term adaptation, and social benefits, but broad consideration and uptake of these approaches has been slow. One barrier to the widespread implementation of hybrid solutions is the lack of a relatively quick but holistic evaluation framework that places these broader environmental and societal goals on equal footing with the more traditional goal of exposure reduction. To respond to this need, the Adaptive Gradients Framework was developed and pilot-tested as a qualitative, flexible, and collaborative process guide for organizations to understand, evaluate, and potentially select more diverse kinds of infrastructural responses. These responses would ideally include natural, nature-based, and regulatory/cultural approaches, as well as hybrid designs combining multiple approaches. It enables rapid expert review of project designs based on eight metrics called \"gradients\", which include exposure reduction, cost efficiency, institutional capacity, ecological enhancement, adaptation over time, greenhouse gas reduction, participatory process, and social benefits. The framework was conceptualized and developed in three phases: relevant factors and barriers were collected from practitioners and experts by survey; these factors were ranked by importance and used to develop the initial framework; several case studies were iteratively evaluated using this technique; and the framework was finalized for implementation. The article presents the framework and a pilot test of its application, along with resources that would enable wider application of the framework by practitioners and theorists. © 2018 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'Background and Aims Coastal protection from erosion and flooding is a significant ecosystem service provided by vegetated marine systems. Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport. Methods Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation. Key Results At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than that of the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10 % greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection. Conclusions We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate. © The Author(s) 2019.

       " \"On the way to more sustainable and resilient urban environments, the incorporation of urban green infrastructure (UGI) systems, such as green roofs and vertical greening systems, must be encouraged. Unfortunately, given their variable nature, these nature-based systems are difficult to geometrically characterize, and therefore there is a lack of 3D objects that adequately reflect their geometry and analytical properties to be used in design processes based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) technologies. This fact can be a disadvantage, during the building's design phase, of UGIs over traditional grey solutions. Areas of knowledge such as precision agriculture, have developed technologies and methodologies that characterize the geometry of vegetation using point cloud capture. The main aim of this research was to create the 3D characterization of an experimental double-skin green facade, using LiDAR technologies. From the results it could be confirmed that the methodology used was precise and robust, enabling the 3D reconstruction of the green facade's outer envelope. Detailed results were that foliage volume differences in height were linked to plant growth, whereas differences in the horizontal distribution of greenery were related to the influence of the local microclimate and specific plant diseases on the south orientation. From this research, along with complementary previous research, it could be concluded that, generally speaking, with vegetation volumes of 0.2 m3/m2, using Boston Ivy (Parthenocissus Tricuspidata) under Mediterranean climate, reductions in external building surface temperatures of around 13 °C can be obtained and used as analytic parameter in a future 3D-BIM-object. © 2021 The Authors\",\n",
       " \"Nature-based measures (NBMs), understood here as measures such as floodplain restoration that use ecosystem processes to meet societal challenges, are increasingly advocated as promising solutions for managing flood risks. A suitable instrument to implement NBMs are flood risk management plans (FRMPs) stipulated by the EU Floods Directive. While prior research suggests several governance challenges for NBM uptake in FRMPs, little is known so far regarding the actual extent of NBM uptake and its role in decision-making of flood risk management. Germany, with a coherent water policy framework but state-specific implementation conditions, provides a suitable case study for exploring the decision-making practices that are used in the planning process for FRMPs by German federal states with different water governance characteristics. The aim of this study is to analyze the actual uptake of NBMs in German FRMPs, and to explore potential factors of the FRMP preparation and decision-making practices explaining this uptake. Our explorative research design is based on a document analysis method which assesses the contents of FRMPs of three German federal states. The results offer the first empirical evidence of the uptake of NBMs in Germany and insights into how NBMs and other measure types are chosen for FRMPs. Our findings confirm an overall low uptake of NBMs, with diverging preferences for particular NBM types between the three states. Looking across the states, the level of NBM uptake is likely to be higher if rivers with higher stream order are considered in the FRMP's spatial scope, the potential flood risk in a river basin is low, and positive flood impacts and positive cost-benefit ratios are expected. We conclude that FRMPs still hold substantial potential to enhance the NBM uptake in flood risk management planning. To make use of this potential, we suggest three key strategies to increase the change for a better NBM uptake including applying FRMPs at different spatial levels and degrees of details. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " \"In expanding informal neighborhoods of cities in sub-Saharan Africa, sustainable management of storm and wastewater drainage is fundamental to improving living conditions. Planners debate the optimal combination between “green” or natural infrastructure, traditional “grey” infrastructure, and “blue” infrastructure, which mimics natural solutions using artificial materials. Many advocate for small-scale, niche experiments with these approaches in informal settings, in order to learn how to navigate the intrinsic constraints of space, contested land tenure, participation, and local maintenance. This paper reports the benefits and limitations of implementing and managing local green, blue and grey infrastructure solutions in an urban informal setting. We studied ten completed public space projects that featured urban drainage infrastructure in the informal neighborhood of Kibera, Nairobi. The analysis drew from ten surveys with project designers and seven semi-structured interviews with site managers. The studied spaces featured different combinations of green, grey, and blue drainage infrastructure that have evolved over years of operation, maintenance, and change in the settlement. All projects featured participation in design, mixed design methods, hybrid infrastructure, and community governance models with potential to interact successfully with municipal actors. Results show that involvement in the co-development of small-scale green infrastructure changed people's valuation, perception, and stewardship of nature-based systems and ecosystem services. These results have implications for the larger scale adoption, integration, and management of urban drainage infrastructure. They also suggest that hybrid systems of infrastructure and governance constitute a resilient approach to incremental and inclusive upgrading. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Inadequate sanitation infrastructure is a global problem that is particularly impacting rural areas. And decentralized wastewater management system is considered as the feasible solution for rural sewage treatment (RuST). However, determining the cost-effective (CE) pattern for decentralized RuST is methodologically challenging because of scarce decision-support tools. In this research, a RuST optimization model (RuST-OM) was developed to gain an insight into the CE pattern of RuST based on the greedy algorithm. This model involves tradeoffs in the economy-of-scale and technology of wastewater treatment system versus the cost and energy consumption of the sewage collection system. The investment associated with the CE pattern for RuST is closely linked to the environmental demand, RuST coverage, topographic complexity, and degree of household dispersion. The cost of the CE pattern falls between the onsite-B and community-based pattern, and this range represents the optimized interval for RuST planning. Nature-based technology is a sustainable alternative for RuST in areas characterized by low or moderate environmental demand. To ensure applicability of the RuST-OM in other countries/regions, built-in datasets (e.g., technology and pipeline design parameters) are designed based on rural area features that can be modified as necessary. This research highlights the utility of the CE pattern for RuST planning, and can serve as a reference for RuST planning around the world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"Novel solutions to conserve biodiversity whilst allowing for resource harvesting are urgently needed. In marine systems, Territorial User Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) are promoted to enable sustainable use of resources. We investigate the potential for synergies between nature-based tourism and TURFs on Chile's central coast. Of 135 recreational divers surveyed, 77% indicated that the fish species they preferred sighting were declining and 80% indicated that they would dive more often in TURFs, which have higher abundance of favoured species. Regression analysis shows that respondents that perceive that TURFs fulfil a conservation function are more willing to pay to dive in a TURF. However, respondents who understand the bureaucratic functioning of a TURF are less willing to pay, and there is diversity in how divers feel payments should be made. A participatory approach is required to navigate these complexities to achieve synergies between nature-based tourism and resource harvesting in TURFs. © 2016 Biggs et al.

       " \"Worldwide, every year 525 000 children under the age of five die from diarrhoea. The simple act of washing hands with soap and water can prevent more than one-third of diarrhoeal disease cases. In the densely populated urban areas of the developing world, handwashing wastewater is commonly discharged to the environment without any treatment, creating unhygienic situations and breeding places for different vectors and wasting a valuable resource. However, this relatively clean wastewater can be treated and reused using simple technological solutions. The objective of our water innovation is, therefore, twofold: improving children's health through stimulating handwashing at schools while at the same time demonstrating the feasibility of water conservation through low-tech, nature-based treatment and safe reuse of handwashing wastewater for irrigation and toilet flushing. To enhance the intrinsic motivation of children and school staff to adopt this innovation, four educational games were developed drawing on theories used in gamification of learning, such as social learning theory and engagement theories. This paper provides an overview of the games and the main results of the game testing. For promoting hygiene among school children, a board and a card game were developed based on the F-diagram – commonly used by water and sanitation practitioners to illustrate the main routes for pathogen transmissions from faeces. In addition, the system linking handwashing wastewater collection, treatment and reuse for irrigation and toilet flushing was simulated by the development of two board games which targeted school children, school staff and the operators of the treatment system. The prototypes and final versions were tested in two schools in the Oromia region in Ethiopia – while the treatment system (constructed wetland) for handwashing wastewater is located in one school. Children that play-tested the games were generally enthusiastic and eager to play repeatedly, which demonstrated that board and card games are appropriate tools to engage with this young target group. We conclude that there is a large potential for development, use, and upscaling of educational games for more sustainable WaSH interventions. © 2020\",\n",
       " \"Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) are engineering solutions for managing storm water, and they can also provide blue spaces that equitably benefit the health and wellbeing of urban dwellers. The main objectives of this study were to test whether affluent neighbourhoods have SuDS with better ecological quality in one of Europe's fastest developing cities, and to investigate whether designable or manageable habitat characteristics of the SuDS, and the adjacent terrestrial area, are related to ecological quality. We estimated SuDS ecological quality by dimension reduction of five biotic and abiotic ecosystem components through performing a Principal Coordinate Analysis. Then we regressed SuDS ecological quality against socio-economic descriptors of the neighbourhood. We next applied non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests and probabilistic co-occurrence analysis to assess associations between habitat characteristics and ecological quality of SuDS. Our data showed that more affluent neighbourhoods have SuDS of higher ecological quality. We identified thresholds for some easily designable and manageable habitat characteristics of SuDS clearly linked to their ecological quality. There was strong co-occurrence of habitat characteristics, with aggregation of features linked to poor and good ecological quality, in SuDS designed as detention basins/swales or ponds respectively. Our results can be applied to the design and management of SuDS to foster good ecological quality irrespective of the neighbourhood. This study will be valuable for building and managing SuDS in a nature-based way, thus providing more socially equitable access to high-quality urban blue space. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'Rising sea levels and the increased frequency of extreme events put coastal communities at serious risk. In response, shoreline armoring for stabilization has been widespread. However, this solution does not take the ecological aspects of the coasts into account. The “living shoreline” technique includes coastal ecology by incorporating natural habitat features, such as saltmarshes, into shoreline stabilization. However, the impacts of living shorelines on adjacent benthic communities, such as submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), are not yet clear. In particular, while both marshes and SAV trap the sediment necessary for their resilience to environmental change, the synergies between the communities are not well-understood. To help quantify the ecological and protective (shoreline stabilization) aspects of living shorelines, we presented modeling results using the Delft3D-SWAN system on sediment transport between the created saltmarshes of the living shorelines and adjacent SAV in a subestuary of Chesapeake Bay. We used a double numerical approach to primarily validate deposition measurements made in the field and to further quantify the sediment balance between the two vegetation communities using an idealized model. This model used the same numerical domain with different wave heights, periods, and basin slopes and includes the presence of rip-rap, which is often used together with marsh plantings in living shorelines, to look at the influences of artificial structures on the sediment exchange between the plant communities. The results of this study indicated lower shear stress, lower erosion rates, and higher deposition rates within the SAV bed compared with the scenario with the marsh only, which helped stabilize bottom sediments by making the sediment balance positive in case of moderate wave climate (deposition within the two vegetations higher than the sediment loss). The presence of rip-rap resulted in a positive sediment balance, especially in the case of extreme events, where sediment balance was magnified. Overall, this study concluded that SAV helps stabilize bed level and shoreline, and rip-rap works better with extreme conditions, demonstrating how the right combination of natural and built solutions can work well in terms of ecology and coastal protection. © Copyright © 2021 Vona, Palinkas and Nardin.',\n",
       " 'Decentralized source-separated wastewater treatment systems offer an attractive alternative to conventional centralized wastewater treatment systems in various regions, yet few system analyses specifically address decentralized greywater treatment over different scales. Here we present a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) and focus on global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential (EUP) and human health – carcinogenic potential (HHCP) of decentralized greywater management systems at different scales for a hypothetical community in a cold (winter) region. To provide a comparison between nature-based and engineered greywater treatment solutions, constructed wetlands (CW) and membrane bioreactors (MBR), respectively, were investigated at three different scales; community (3500 person equivalent [PE]), neighborhood (350 PE) and household (a single household [up to 5 PE]). Conventional centralized wastewater treatment was also included as a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. In the MBR scenarios, greywater reuse was also considered for multiple non-potable applications due to its high-quality effluent and subsurface garden irrigation was considered for reuse in the CW scenarios. For scenarios with the same treatment technology, larger scales reduced GWP, EUP and HHCP up to 57 kg CO2-eq.PE−1.y−1, 0.2 kg N-eq.PE−1.y−1 and 5.3E-6 CTUh.PE−1.y−1, respectively, despite the need for more extensive wastewater networks. The CW scenarios at community and neighborhood scales outperformed the MBR and BAU scenarios for greywater treatment, while the community-scale MBR scenario may be environmentally preferable when large amount of greywater can be reused. The scale of decentralized systems, quantity of water reused and mix of electricity technologies all played important roles in determining GWP, EUP and HHCP values. © 2019 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Green Infrastructure promotes the use of natural functions and processes as potential solutions to reduce negative effects derived from anthropocentric interventions such as urbanization. In cities of Latin America, for example, the need for more nature-based infrastructure is evident due to its degree of urbanization and degradation of ecosystems, as well as the alteration of the local water cycle. In this study, an experimental approach for the implementation of a prototype is presented. The prototype consists of a gray-hybrid element for first flush bio-treatment and runoff detention, adapted to the existing stormwater sewer. The experiment took place in a highly urbanized watershed located in the Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. The characteristics of the existing infrastructure in the study area at different scales were mapped and compared using the Urban Water System Transition Framework. Subsequently, preferences related to spatial locations and technologies were identified from different local decision-makers. Those insights were adopted to identify a potential area for the implementation of the prototype. The experiment consisted of the adaptation of the local sewer to act as a temporal reservoir to reduce the effects derived from rapid generation of stormwater runoff. Unexpected events, not considered initially in the design, are reported in this study as a means to identify the necessary adaptations of the methodology. Our study shows from an experimental learning-experience that the relation between different actors advocating for such technologies influences the implementation and operation of non-conventional technologies. Furthermore, the willingness of residents to modify their urban environments was found to be associated to their own perceptions about security and vandalism occurring in green spaces. The implementation of the prototype showed that both the hydraulic performance is relevant for considering it as a success, as well as the dynamics of the adapted element with the existing urban conditions. In consequence, those aspects should be carefully considered as the design factors of engineering elements when they are related to complex socio-ecological urban systems. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Water resources worldwide are under severe stress from increasing climate variability and human pressures. In the tropical Andes, pre-Inca cultures developed nature-based water harvesting technologies to manage drought risks under natural climatic extremes. While these technologies have gained renewed attention as a potential strategy to increase water security, limited scientific evidence exists about their potential hydrological contributions at catchment scale. Here, we evaluate a 1,400-year-old indigenous infiltration enhancement system that diverts water from headwater streams onto mountain slopes during the wet season to enhance the yield and longevity of downslope natural springs. Infiltrated water is retained for an average of 45 d before resurfacing, confirming the system’s ability to contribute to dry-season flows. We estimate that upscaling the system to the source-water areas of the city of Lima can potentially delay 99 × 106 m3 yr−1 of streamflow and increase dry-season flows by 7.5% on average, which may provide a critical complement to conventional engineering solutions for water security. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.',\n",
       " 'Though innovations for sustainable management of natural resources have emerged over time, the rising demand for nature based health solutions and integration of endemic flora into global value chains could have adverse impacts on ecosystems. The ecological risks in the exploitation of the wild endemic medicinal plant resources are exacerbated by a myriad of agrotechnological risks and challenges that highly constrain their domestication. Successful exploitation and commercialisation of medicinal plants thus require a clear understanding of their demand and production systems or value chain analysis. Accordingly there is need for innovative approaches towards their integration into global value chains. Since quality and safety, traceability, certification, as well as consumer tastes and preferences are critical drivers in purchasing decisions by global consumers, they are inadvertently exploited to weaken Indigenous knowledge (IK), undermine common property rights and entrench value chains that favour a few elite buyers. This tend to create pervasive incentives for overexploitation of medicinal plant resources and environmental degradation. Potential solution lies in the recognition of drivers of vulnerability to environmental degradation and the innovative use of policy bricolage, feedback loops and interactions between knowledge, power and agency on one hand, and collective action and property rights institutions on the other hand. We conceptualise a framework that can mediate a transformational agenda and enhance systematic understanding of sustainability lenses in endemic medicinal plant resources value chains. This could strengthen IK, enhance collective action and promote participation of local actors with positive impact on the utilisation and integration of endemic medicinal plant resources into global value chains. © 2020 The Author(s)',\n",

       " \"The increasing demand for visiting wilderness areas often requires management actions that both conserve the natural resources and ensure a high quality visitor experience. Many of the alpine national parks in southern Norway hold the last remaining populations of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Therefore management needs more effective tools to reduce or remove recreational impact on wild reindeer populations. Management actions should also consult research-based knowledge on visitors. Therefore, this study explores the link between visitor motivations and their attitudes towards management actions on track-related (trail, path, trampling, track) and area-related (zoning, legal restrictions) use. The results show that two of the visitor motivations (i.e. hiking and place attachment) affect visitors' attitudes towards management restrictions on use significantly. For instance, those visiting the national park for hiking are more positive to area-related restrictions while individuals attached to the place are more positive to track-related restrictions. Practical and theoretical implications are also discussed. Management implications When attempting to find socio-ecological solutions for conflicts between a wild reindeer population and recreational use, the following management recommendations should be considered: A management solution should regard the fact that local users differ significantly from non-local visitors.The strategy of 'area restriction' is highly controversial for local communities, due to their long tradition with subsistence harvesting, grazing and traditional agriculture; therefore such a strategy will receive only low approval among the locals and leave the management with low legitimacy at the local level.The strategy of 'management of the track system' will affect most non-local visitors, but these visitors are more flexible in adapting to a new trail system in the area, or may shift to another area.Visitors with strong place attachment, as well as wilderness seekers who desire solitude are difficult to influence with physical management actions.A management strategy that will limit the area of use and behaviour of off-track visitors should include information about ecosystem vulnerability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept combines advanced technological processes like membrane bioreactors, specific phosphorus (P) adsorption columns and ultrafiltration (UF) with nature-based treatment processes like wetland and bank filtration mechanisms. The project's approach is not only to comply with the reclamation requests of the Olympic Green 2008, but also to give an example for better, adapted and energy efficient reuse applications throughout China. The study shows that fixed-bed granular ferric hydroxide (GFH) adsorbers after a membrane bioreactor (MBR) can maintain a total phosphorus (TP) concentration of &lt;0.03 mg L-1.

The use of mulches can be a solution, but there is a lack of information on long-term effects of the use of straw. Furthermore, little is known about the perception of farmers and the economic cost on the implantation of straw as a conservation measure. Eight paired plots were selected in Sierra de Enguera on an agriculture field to determine the effect of straw cover on soil erosion. Four plots were tilled three times per year (Control) and four plots were not ploughed and 0.125 kg m−2 y−1 of oat straw cover was applied yearly (Straw). The plots were established in 2002, and runoff and sediment was continuously collected after each rainfall event from 2004 till 2014 when the two managements were applied. The results show an immediate effect of the straw mulches as in these plots the runoff (from 7.7 till 5.9%) and soil erosion (from 47 till 26 Mg ha−1 y−1) was reduced already in the first year. The combined effect of the use of straw yearly and the no-tillage strategy resulted in a reduction of the sediment yield, and 11 years later soil erosion rates were two orders of magnitude lower than in the control plot. However, the perception of the farmers on the use of straw is very negative and they claim that subsidies need to be implemented, as the cost of straw mulch is 1.9 times more expensive than traditional tillage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

       " 'The increasing impacts of climate hazards combined with the loss of coastal habitats require urgent solutions to manage risk. Storm losses continue to grow and much of them are uninsured. These losses represent an increasing burden to individuals, businesses, and can jeopardize national development goals. Pre-hazard mitigation is cost effective, but both the public and private sector struggle to finance up-front investments in it. This article explores a resilience solution that combines risk transfer (e.g., insurance) with risk reduction (e.g., hazard mitigation), which have often been treated as two separate mechanisms for disaster risk management. The combined mechanism could help align environmental and risk management goals and create opportunities for public and private investment in nature-based projects. We assessed this resilience insurance with hypothetical cases for coral reef restoration. Under conservative assumptions, 44% of the initial reef restoration costs would be covered just by insurance premium reductions in the first 5 years, with benefits amounting >6 times the total costs over 25 years. We also test the sensitivity to key factors such as project cost, risk reduction potential, insurance structure, economic exposure and discount rates. The resilience insurance mechanism is applicable to many coastlines and can help finance nature-based adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

However, more recent storms such as Superstorm Sandy revealed the shortcomings of gray solutions, and therefore the notion of adaptability has been directed to the use of green infrastructure. In flood risk management, nature-based strategies have already proven considerable flood-reducing potential while effectively conserving the ecosystem. However, while nature-based approaches are extremely beneficial in preserving the ecological characteristics of the region, they cannot be solely relied on when it comes to rarely occurring events such as extreme floods. Best management practices (BMPs) are one of the most commonly used safeguards in which natural elements can be integrated into traditional infrastructure designs. In this paper, different strategies are proposed to highlight the immense effects of combining green and gray approaches on both flood mitigation and prevention cost. These strategies focus on flow through vegetation (dense plants), which could be patterned as flow through porous media; and were applied to Westchester Creek, New York. Suggested conceptual designs were then simulated in a hydrologic model. Flood inundation maps generated through the modeling process were then compared in five different scenarios including before and after BMPs. The results of this study showed how the combination of levee and vegetation could significantly lower surge effects while proving to be cost-effective. The methodology outlined in this paper can be used for other urban coastal settings to plan for flood preparedness. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.',\n",
       " 'The coastal lagoon of Lesina, is situated on the Italian southern Adriatic coast, in a primarily rural area. Agriculture is the primary economic activity, while the lagoon supports only small scale fisheries and one aquafarm enterprise. However, the lagoon ecological state shows a slow but constant deterioration. In this study, we a) assess the causes for this decline; b) evaluate why the existing regulations have failed to protect the environment from this deterioration; c) explore the potential for community involvement in the management of the lagoon; d) formulate suggestions for developing a management plan that will ensure the preservation of the lagoon and the well-being of the community, according to a shared stakeholders’ vision. For this purpose, available social, economic and physical data were gathered, organized and successively used to identify the causes for the lagoon deterioration. We found that the main causes are: increased discharge of sediments and nutrients from inland activities; unmanaged fishing; loss of human capital; unclear regulations due to vertical and horizontal lack of coordination among authorities. Further, three workshops were conducted with local stakeholders to identify the multiple problems affecting the lagoon area and discuss possible shared solutions. The workshops highlighted that participants perceived the lagoon as an unexploited source of income, mostly in terms of nature based tourism, and suggested that negative externalities caused by the inland activities and mismanagement of the fishery sector should be accounted for by the authorities. However, the mapping of stakeholders indicates that the tourist sector in the area is not developed enough to effectively promote in a bottom-up fashion the development of a management plan of the lagoon area, which could encourage sustainable tourism by protecting the lagoon and generating economic development for the area. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'In Mauritius island in the Indian Ocean, as in most low-lying coastal areas and Small Island Developing States in particular, coastal risks affect community livelihood, economic prosperity and the degradation of natural ecosystems. Risks of coastal erosion and marine flooding result both from climate-related ocean changes and anthropogenic drivers such as inappropriate coastal development and structural protection measures. Poor development planning and lack of coordination between public and private actors have increased the exposure of human assets along the Mauritius coastline. To reduce these risks, the government leads risk reduction activities in coastal zones, functioning on a centralized top-down governance approach. In recent years, this governance framework has been evolving by opening up participatory channels and exploring a long-term adaptation perspective. Progress is driven by international engagements and demonstration projects to embrace soft measures, nature-based options and integrated solutions. We review a selection of pilot projects undertaken by the government that illustrate flexibility in a ‘learning by doing’ model. However, we find that certain governance arrangements do not allow to draw the most from ad hoc projects because they do not feed into a long-term comprehensive plan. We consider the role of evidence and risk assessments, learning processes and coordination mechanisms as key governance mechanisms required for a robust and evolving national coastal risk reduction and adaptation policy framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'It is becoming increasingly popular to reintroduce beaver to streams with the hopes of restoring riparian ecosystem function or reducing some of the hydrological impacts of climate change. One of the risks of relying on beaver to enhance ecosystem water storage is that their dams are reportedly more apt to fail during floods which can exacerbate flood severity. Missing are observations of beaver dam persistence and water storage capacity during floods, information needed to evaluate the risk of relying on beaver as a nature-based flood solution. A June rainstorm in 2013 triggered the largest recorded flood in the Canadian Rocky Mountains west of Calgary, Alberta. We opportunistically recorded hydrometric data during the rainfall event at a beaver-occupied peatland that has been studied for more than a decade. We supplemented these observations with a post-event regional analysis of beaver dam persistence. Results do not support two long-held hypotheses—that beaver ponds have limited flood attenuation capacity and commonly fail during large flood events. Instead we found that 68% of the beaver dam cascade systems across the region were intact or partially intact after the event. Pond fullness, in addition to the magnitude of the water-sediment surge, emerged as important factors in determining the structural fate of dam cascade sequences. Beaver ponds at the instrumented site quickly filled in the first few hours of the rain event and levels were dynamic during the event. Water storage offered by the beaver ponds, even ones that failed, delayed downstream floodwater transmission. Study findings have important implications for reintroducing beaver as part of nature-based restoration and climate change adaptation strategies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd',\n",
       " 'Over recent years, many coastal engineering projects have employed the use of soft solutions as these are generally less environmentally damaging than hard solutions. However, in some cases, local conditions hinder the use of soft solutions, meaning that hard solutions have to be adopted or, sometimes, a combination of hard and soft measures is seen as optimal. This research reviews the use of hard coastal structures on the foreshore (groynes, breakwaters and jetties) and onshore (seawalls and dikes). The purpose, functioning and local conditions for which these structures are most suitable are outlined. A description is provided on the negative effects that these structures may have on morphological, hydrodynamic and ecological conditions. To reduce or mitigate these negative impacts, or to create new ecosystem services, the following nature-based adaptations are proposed and discussed: (1) applying soft solutions complementary to hard solutions, (2) mitigating morphological and hydrodynamic changes and (3) ecologically enhancing hard coastal structures. The selection and also the success of these potential adaptations are highly dependent on local conditions, such as hydrodynamic forcing, spatial requirements and socioeconomic factors. The overview provided in this paper aims to offer an interdisciplinary understanding, by giving general guidance on which type of solution is suitable for given characteristics, taking into consideration all aspects that are key for environmentally sensitive coastal designs. Overall, this study aims to provide guidance at the interdisciplinary design stage of nature-based coastal defence structures. © 2019, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.',\n",
       " 'Coastal erosion is a natural process, whose intensity and occurrence have increased due to natural and anthropogenic factors. To protect the coasts, the use of hard infrastructure is a widespread practice that can be effective, mostly at a local scale. However, recent evidence also shows that downstream erosion can be accelerated in adjacent zones. Because of this, natural barriers such as coastal dunes and their plant cover have gained attention, but there is a general lack of information about the role that different species (and combinations of species) play in coastal protection. The aim of this study was to explore if the functional richness of plant species helps reduce wave erosion on embryo coastal dunes. In a wave flume, we set up a 1:1 scale artificial dune covered with different combinations of plant species (Ipomoeae pes-caprae, Sesuvium portulacastrum, and Sporobolus virginicus) and exposed it to simulated “storm waves”. We found that erosion was reduced in dunes covered by plants, but such protection was species-specific and the effectiveness of protection varied over time. Ipomoea was the most effective specie for protection. Differences between species and combinations of species were associated with their physical attributes such as growth form and plant architecture. Although we found that there are species that offer little or no protection from hydrodynamic forces, they may still be important for coastal protection through their ability to build embryo dunes through eolian processes. Indeed, nature-based coastal protection is likely to be an effective alternative to engineered solutions at many sites, but the protection provided is species-specific. © 2019, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.',\n",
       " 'Guided interactions with nature form part of integration programmes aimed at immigrant groups in Nordic societies. Based on data collected on several Swedish Nature-Based Integration (NBI) projects this article examines the rituals nature guides employ on guided walks. It explores how guides enact taskscapes through structured and improvised ritual activity. These taskscapes integrate a moral universe encapsulating nature and society; provide meeting sites for groups of diverse backgrounds; and are a potential base for a wider environmental social movement. I describe moments of apparent integration and conflict over past, present and future usage of nature. Nature guides are prominent in managing tensions and contradictions around integration, a concept containing inherently coercive elements. Guides thus should be aware that their activities may contribute to societal conflicts as well as conciliation. This is of particular relevance with NBI increasingly framed as a potential solution to the ‘problems’ of immigration. © 2020 The Author(s).

       " 'Protected areas are a central strategy for achieving global conservation goals, but their continued existence depends heavily on maintaining sufficient social and political support to outweigh economic interests or other motives for land conversion. Thus, the resilience of protected areas can be considered a function of their perceived benefits to society. Nature-based tourism (NBT), a cultural ecosystem service, provides a key source of income to protected areas, facilitating a sustainable solution to conservation. The ability of tourism to generate income depends, however, on both the scales at which this cultural service is provided and the scales at which tourists respond to services on offer. This observation raises a set of location-, context-, and scale-related questions that need to be confronted before we can understand and value cultural service provision appropriately. We combine elements of resilience analysis with a systems ecology framework and apply this to NBT in protected areas to investigate cross-scale interactions and scale mismatches. We postulate that cross-scale effects can either have a positive effect on protected area resilience or lead to scale mismatches, depending on their interactions with cross-scale feedbacks. To demonstrate this, we compare spatial scales and nested levels of institutions to develop a typology of scale mismatches for common scenarios in NBT. In our new typology, the severity of a scale mismatch is expressed as the ratio of spatial scale to institutional level, producing 25 possible outcomes with differing consequences for system resilience. We predict that greater differences between interacting scales and levels, and greater magnitudes of cross-scale interactions, will lead to greater magnitudes of scale mismatch. Achieving a better understanding of feedbacks and mismatches, and finding ways of aligning spatial and institutional scales, will be critical for strengthening the resilience of protected areas that depend on NBT. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America',\n",
       " \"The Azores Archipelago (Portugal) is composed of 9 small islands located in the North Atlantic. To overcome the common challenges of this type of territory (e.g. isolation, closed systems, limited physical space and natural resources, endemism, small economies, small populations) and taking advantage of the natural and cultural heritage, the Regional Government of the Azores has based its Tourism Strategy on the high value of nature, landscape, flag species and outdoor experiences with a strong environmental friendly label. Pico Island offers the perfect scenario to enjoy such nature-based tourism activities, welcoming around 15,000 tourists per year, equivalent to the number of residents on the island. The island's natural and cultural heritage is outstanding and Pico Island Natural Park represents 35% of the territory, including several coastal and marine areas. Tourists' awareness about Pico protected areas, their activities and preferences can be extremely important to the management of the Island Natural Park. Integrated in the research project SMARTPARKS, a survey was conducted with 134 tourists, revealing the importance assigned to Pico protected areas and coastal zone. Among coastal and maritime activities, bathing and whale watching are the most frequent activities (57% and 44% of respondents, respectively) and 20% of respondents think whale watching should be promoted.

       " \"Nearly 50 years after Hardin's “tragedy of the commons” we have not yet found predictive tools to guide us towards sustainable management of common-pool resources (CPR). We often have a good understanding of the qualitative relationships between the principal actors in socioecological systems (SESs), but classical quantitative approaches require a tremendous amount of data to understand the drivers of SESs sustainability. Here we show that qualitative modelling approaches can provide important governance insights for SESs that are understood but not quantified. We used Loop Analysis to test the outcomes of different management regimes on a simple nature-based tourism SES described by economic, social and environmental variables. We tested the sustainability of different management scenarios on this system and we identified the necessary conditions to achieve it. We found that management regimes where property rights and responsibilities are shared between different stakeholders are more likely to be successful. However, the system is generally highly unstable and it is important to tune each strategy to each particular situation. The conditions for sustainability found across the different systems tested were: a low reinvestment rate of tourist revenues into new infrastructures and a low growth rate of the environment. Management strategies based on maximum sustainable yield, which keep the environment far from its carrying capacity, have less chance to be sustainable. Qualitative models of SESs are powerful diagnostic tools; they can help identifying variables that play an important role in determining socioecological sustainability in data-poor circumstances and guide the design of efficient data collection programmes. Our results highlight the importance of careful planning when designing management strategies for nature-based tourism. The application of one-size-fits-all solutions to every situation is likely to lead to the failure of the commons; however tourism-based SESs can be sustainable if management strategies are tuned to each particular case. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Surface and groundwater in cities and downstream urban areas may suffer from serious pollution from point and diffuse sources from upstream and in-catchment, which might have a negative impact on the ecology, quality of life and land values of the city. Enhanced nature-based treatment solutions (such as constructed wetlands) have the potential to remove pollutants from the water (e.g. storm water, urban run-off, river water and wastewater) that will lead to improved water quality and water use efficiency. Such natural treatment measures, when well organised and integrated into the overall urban planning and design, can also contribute to climate adaptation by reducing drought/flood risk and constitute attractive components of the urban landscape. The constructed wetlands are a strategic nature-based technology for Nepal, where discharge of untreated wastewater into rivers, lakes or any other water body is a common practice. Constructed wetlands are highly efficient in removing organic, insoluble substances and some pesticides, and their construction and operation are both simple and cost-effective. However, the main conditions of the successful implementation of the constructed wetlands in Nepal (and the other developing countries) should be clearly stated. Legislation and standards in Nepal are weak and, therefore, wastewater treatment is not a priority for city governments and private institutions. Despite constructed wetlands being a low-cost technology, it might be difficult to convince people to pay for their wastewater treatment. The key issue is \"who\"takes the responsibility for their maintenance and how this responsibility is defined and granted. Our paper discusses the best and worst practices in the Kathmandu Valley and the conditions that could influence the successful implementation of the nature-based treatment solutions in developing countries more generally. © 2020 WIT Press.',\n",
       " 'Flood risk is increasing across the world due to climate change and socio-economic development, calling for a shift from traditional protection and post-event activism towards a forward-looking, risk-aware, and more holistic resilience approach. The national legal system of countries can play an important role in creating and encouraging such a shift. In this study, we explore the potentials and shortcomings of national laws in managing flood risk and increasing flood resilience in the context of climate change. We analyze 139 laws from 33 countries collected from the Climate Change Laws of the World and Disaster Law databases and underpin this with case studies to gain insights on the interplay between national laws and resilience processes. We find: (1) a shift in flood laws from focusing on flooding as a natural resource and water resource management issue towards a broader consideration of disaster risk management (DRM) and climate adaptation policy; (2) a significant lack of climate change recognition in laws regulating decisions and actions for future flood risks, especially in DRM; (3) a prevailing focus on response and recovery strategies and a lack of recognition of risk reduction strategies and proactive flood risk governance approaches; and (4) little recognition of natural capital (comparing to physical capital) and its role in increasing flood resilience. Key policy insights Flood-related laws around the world lack consideration of future risks. Disaster risk management and climate change are often considered as separate issues in national laws, which can lead to gaps in institutional ownership, responsibilities, and allocated budgets. Flood-related laws are mainly created after major events, most of which are focused on reactive strategies (i.e. response and recovery). Laws can facilitate the shift from post-event response to anticipatory actions by encouraging proactive flood risk management (FRM) activities (i.e. risk reduction). Nature-based solutions often remain unrecognized in national laws due to the dominant focus on hard engineering measures. FRM should be treated as a holistic concept in laws: ensuring all the necessary human, social, physical, natural and financial systems are in place to support it. © 2020 The Author(s).

       " 'Hydraulic engineering infrastructure is supposed to keep functioning for many years and is likely to interfere with both the natural and the social environment at various scales. Due to its long life-cycle, hydraulic infrastructure is bound to face changing environmental conditions as well as changes in societal views on acceptable solutions. This implies that sustainability and adaptability are/ should be important attributes of the design, the development and operation of hydraulic engineering infrastructure. Sustainability and adaptability are central to the Building with Nature (BwN) approach. Although nature-based design philosophies, such as BwN, have found broad support, a key issue that inhibits a wider mainstream implementation is the lack of a method to objectify BwN concepts. With objectifying, we mean turning the implicit into an explicit engineerable ‘object’, on the one hand, and specifying clear design ‘objectives’, on the other. This paper proposes the “Frame of Reference” approach as a method to systematically transform BwN concepts into functionally specified engineering designs. It aids the rationalisation of BwN concepts and facilitates the transfer of crucial information between project development phases, which benefits the uptake, acceptance and eventually the successful realisation of BwN solutions. It includes an iterative approach that is well suited for assessing status changes of naturally dynamic living building blocks of BwN solutions. The applicability of the approach is shown for a case that has been realised in the Netherlands. Although the example is Dutch, the method, as such, is generically applicable. © 2021 TU Delft.

       " 'The alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau, which account for about 40% of the total grassland area in China, serve as an important ecological barrier to protect China\\'s water resources and for ecological security. Although the vegetation activity of alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau has been overall improving during the past decades, most of the grasslands are still suffering from varying degrees of degradation, with some part even deteriorating. In the present protection and construction of ecological barriers on the Tibetan Plateau, the restoration of the degraded alpine grasslands through current technical approaches often end up with low stability and sustainability, and the ecosystem multifunctionality and multiserviceability of the grasslands are often difficult to be fully recovered. This is mainly because the present approaches rarely draw support from the natural restoration processes, along with the technical limitations of optimizing the assembly and supplementary sowing with appropriate native grass species that are often rare, and of improving soil quality using microbial fertilizer and nutrients. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an effective and sustainable restoration approach of the degraded alpine grasslands. The primary tasks of close-to-nature restoration with ecological conservation as its premise focuses on maintaining biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem multifunctionality and multiserviceability. Close-to-nature restoration adopts traditional artificial restoration approaches and relies on natural ecological processes to achieve sustainable ecological restoration. It focuses on \"based on nature\" and \"return to nature\", and realizes sustainable restoration through the self-regulating function of natural ecosystem. Therefore, ecosystems that are restored through close-to-nature restoration may maintain higher biodiversity, provide more ecosystem functions and services, and increase resilience to natural disasters. This paper proposes to apply the close-to-nature restoration to recover degraded alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau, and addresses why it is a natural choice on the basis of ecological theories with respect to biodiversity and the multi-functionality and multiserviceability of ecosystems, as well as the uniqueness of alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. Based on this, this paper further proposes that seed multiplication, and assembly and supplementary sowing technology of native grassland species are the bottlenecks to the close-to-nature restoration of alpine grasslands, and that the combination of soil nutrients and microbial regulation is an essential supplementary measure. This study, which integrates the theory of close-to-nature restoration and the corresponding techniques, hopefully can provide a nature-based solution for the restoration of the degraded alpine grassland ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau. © 2020, Science Press.

We are addressing seagrass loss resulting from nutrient pollution which is about one third of the total. The technical objective is to remove at least as much total nitrogen from the sediment and bottom waters to allow restoration with the subsequent successful planting of seeds from nearby meadows. Our nature-based process starts with the eutrophication-induced restriction on the process to remove excess nitrogen from the top layer of sediment, coupled nitrification denitrification (CND). Decaying organic matter and biogeochemical processes consume enough oxygen to reduce the efficiency and capacity of the CND process. The solution is to increase the rate of dissolved oxygen flux in the bottom waters. Although science has known this for 20 years, how to do it has been a mystery. To facilitate oxygen dissolution, we will use nanoscale oxygen bubbles mixed with bottom water and delivered to the water/sediment interface. © 2021, Marine Technology Society Inc..

Regarding the above mentioned, \"Plan Yaque\" (Plan for the Sustainable Development of the Yaque del Norte River Basin) has implemented a relatively cost-effective solution in \"El Dorado,\" a small peri-urban settlement in Jarabacoa municipality. Nonpoint source pollution was converted into point source through a system that collects all the sewage from each septic tank and, then, brings those wastewaters into a nature-based treatment system (constructed wetland with the subsurface flow). This work shows the results obtained in the assessment of the design and exploitation of a wastewater treatment system targeting to reduce the pollution\\'s load that is affecting the Yaque del Norte River Basin. The treatment system is based on a sewer system that brings the sewage from the houses into two septic tanks, from where they are brought to a constructed wetland. The 70 m2 wetland was designed to treat the sewage generated by 75 inhabitants. Because of the treatment, the decrease of the pollutant\\'s load into the inflowing sewage achieved an average removal value of 93% for COD, 95% for BOD, 98% for fecal coliforms and 44% for phosphorus as orthophosphate.

       " 'Coastal vegetation such as seagrass fields, salt marshes, and mangroves, contributes to coastal defence by damping incoming waves. Yet, plant species differ in flexibility due to which they interact differently with incoming waves and damp waves to a variable degree. Current wave damping models struggle to balance accuracy against computational costs when accounting for wave-vegetation interactions. Instead, they often rely on a plant-specific calibration of the drag coefficient, which limits their application across plant species. Here we show, using novel simultaneous experimental data of wave damping, water velocities and stem motion, that wave damping by quasi-flexible cylindrical vegetation is controlled by the relative velocity between water and vegetation at the upright bottom section of a stem. For the quasi-flexible vegetation conditions considered in this manuscript (L>1.4 and Ca<700), our experimental evidence justifies the application of a model based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to estimate plant motion. Building on the solution of plant motion, we simulate wave damping over flexible vegetation fields through a new work factor. Our model successfully predicts damping of regular waves by rigid and flexible artificial vegetation, and real S. Anglica, P. Maritima and E. Athericus plants in the right order of magnitude under medium and high energy wave conditions. The simulated wave damping is directly linked to vegetation and wave conditions and does not require a plant-specific calibration of the drag coefficient.

       " \"The State of Washington, USA, has set a goal to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the year around which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommended we must limit global warming to 1.5 ◦C above that of pre-industrial times or face catastrophic changes. We employed existing approaches to calculate the potential for a suite of Natural Climate Solution (NCS) pathways to reduce Washington's net emissions under three implementation scenarios: Limited, Moderate, and Ambitious. We found that NCS could reduce emissions between 4.3 and 8.8 MMT CO2eyr−1 in thirty-one years, accounting for 4% to 9% of the State's net zero goal. These potential reductions largely rely on changing forest management practices on portions of private and public timber lands. We also mapped the distribution of each pathway's Ambitious potential emissions reductions by county, revealing spatial clustering of high potential reductions in three regions closely tied to major business sectors: private industrial forestry in southwestern coastal forests, cropland agriculture in the Columbia Basin, and urban and rural development in the Puget Trough. Overall, potential emissions reductions are provided largely by a single pathway, Extended Timber Harvest Rotations, which mostly clusters in southwestern counties. However, mapping distribution of each of the other pathways reveals wider distribution of each pathway's unique geographic relevance to support fair, just, and efficient deployment. Although the relative potential for a single pathway to contribute to statewide emissions reductions may be small, they could provide co-benefits to people, communities, economies, and nature for adaptation and resiliency across the state.

       " 'In this study, we explore the use of unsteady transit time distribution (TTD) theory to model solute transport in biofilters, a popular form of nature-based or “green” storm water infrastructure (GSI). TTD theory has the potential to address many unresolved challenges associated with predicting pollutant fate and transport through these systems, including unsteadiness in the water balance (time-varying inflows, outflows, and storage), unsteadiness in pollutant loading, time-dependent reactions, and scale-up to GSI networks and urban catchments. From a solution to the unsteady age conservation equation under uniform sampling, we derive an explicit expression for solute breakthrough during and after one or more storm events. The solution is calibrated and validated with breakthrough data from 17 simulated storms at a field-scale biofilter test facility in Southern California, using bromide as a conservative tracer. TTD theory closely reproduces bromide breakthrough concentrations, provided that lateral exchange with the surrounding soil is accounted for. At any given time, according to theory, more than half of the water in storage is from the most recent storm, while the rest is a mixture of penultimate and earlier storms. Thus, key management endpoints, such as the pollutant treatment credit attributable to GSI, are likely to depend on the evolving age distribution of water stored and released by these systems. © 2020.

       " 'The intensity of major storm events generated within the Atlantic Basin is projected to rise with the warming of the oceans, which is likely to exacerbate coastal erosion. Nature-based flood defence has been proposed as a sustainable and effective solution to protect coastlines. However, the ability of natural ecosystems to withstand major storms like tropical hurricanes has yet to be thoroughly tested. Seagrass meadows both stabilise sediment and attenuate waves, providing effective coastal protection services for sandy beaches. To examine the tolerance of Caribbean seagrass meadows to extreme storm events, and to investigate the extent of protection they deliver to beaches, we employed a combination of field surveys, biomechanical measurements and wave modelling simulations. Field surveys of seagrass meadows before and after a direct hit by the category 5 Hurricane Irma documented that established seagrass meadows of Thalassia testudinum remained unaltered after the extreme storm event. The flexible leaves and thalli of seagrass and calcifying macroalgae inhabiting the meadows were shown to sustain the wave forces that they are likely to experience during hurricanes. In addition, the seagrass canopy and the complex biogeomorphic landscape built by the seagrass meadows combine to significantly dissipate extreme wave forces, ensuring that erosion is minimised within sandy beach foreshores. The persistence of the Caribbean seagrass meadows and their coastal protection services during extreme storm events ensures that a stable coastal ecosystem and beach foreshore is maintained in tropical regions. © 2020, The Author(s).',\n",
       " \"Human use and degradation of coastal ecosystems is at an all-time high. Thus, a current challenge for environmental management and research is moving beyond ecological definitions of success and integrating socioeconomic factors. Projects and studies with this aim, however, have focused primarily on monetary valuations of ecosystem functions, overlooking the behaviors and psycho-social motivations of environmental management. Using a nature-based salt marsh restoration project on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, we assess the role of human attitudes and preferences in evaluating social success for ecosystem management. We use structural equation modeling to compare the strengths of social variables in predicting restoration project support, and find public understanding to be a more important predictor than personal values. Our results show that even among stakeholders with strong pro-environmental values, a weak understanding of the management initiative can undermine support. We also find that project support does not necessarily translate to the prioritization of similar management strategies. Instead, when individuals consider overall management priorities, differences arise between particular resource user-groups. This suggests that strong public support for individual initiatives can misconstrue complexities in stakeholder preferences that emerge in more comprehensive management considerations. Future investigations of the psycho-social components of management solutions should address the potentially tiered nature of human preferences, as well as whether public perceptions of management effectiveness act as an additional context-dependency of social viability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",

Using this information, experts identified 16 potential nature-based and collaborative (involving other water users) solutions to future water scarcity. We used multi-criteria analysis to select five of the 16 solutions for further analysis. Two solutions (marsh wastewater treatment, land management) were not cost-competitive and three solutions (reservoir flood pool reallocation/floodplain restoration, irrigation efficiency, municipal rebate program) were cost-competitive with the business-as-usual solution (expanding reservoir storage). However, these solutions have significant technical, legal, and political hurdles. We also found that these solutions provide substantial collective benefits to the public and biodiversity, suggesting that such solutions may be appropriate for implementation via multi-stakeholder collaboration. © 2014 The Authors.\",\n",
       " 'Boundary organizations are non-traditional structures that can foster transdisciplinary relationships and help catalyze the exchange of ideas, trust, and ultimately the implementation of scientific evidence into policy. Here, we describe GE-21, a group composed of researchers and public servants interested in promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services in Geneva, Switzerland, as an example of such a structure. GE-21 developed into a de facto social experiment for fostering inter- and transdisciplinary science and promoting nature-based policies. The results of two ecosystem-based projects carried by GE-21 were rapidly adopted into policy. Here, we provide a post-hoc narrative based on reports, interviews, and observations that collectively assess the merits and drawbacks of such structures for mainstreaming ecosystem services. We contend that the following five characteristics of this boundary organization may have facilitated its role as a conduit between academic research and public agencies: 1) projects proposing timely, relevant, and novel solutions to policy needs; 2) institutional support for applied interdisciplinary research; 3) a ‘safe space’ to express ideas and develop close relationships over time; 4) availability of high-quality spatial data at a relevant scale, and scientific capacity to treat them; 5) resources dedicated to communication. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'Tropical secondary forests sequester carbon up to 20 times faster than old-growth forests. This rate does not capture spatial regrowth patterns due to environmental and disturbance drivers. Here we quantify the influence of such drivers on the rate and spatial patterns of regrowth in the Brazilian Amazon using satellite data. Carbon sequestration rates of young secondary forests (&lt;20\\xa0years) in the west are ~60% higher (3.0 ± 1.0 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) compared to those\\xa0in the east (1.3 ± 0.3 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). Disturbances reduce regrowth rates by 8–55%. The 2017 secondary forest carbon stock, of 294 Tg C, could be 8% higher by avoiding fires and repeated deforestation. Maintaining the 2017 secondary forest area has the potential to accumulate ~19.0 Tg C yr−1 until 2030, contributing ~5.5% to Brazil’s 2030 net emissions reduction target. Implementing legal mechanisms to protect and expand secondary forests whilst supporting old-growth conservation is, therefore, key to realising their potential as a nature-based climate solution. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Vegetation provides habitat and nature-based solutions to coastal flooding and erosion, drawing significant interest in its restoration, which requires an understanding of sediment transport and retention. Laboratory experiments examined the influence of stem diameter and arrangement on bedload sediment transport by considering arrays of different stem diameter and mixed diameters. Bedload transport rate was observed to depend on turbulent kinetic energy, with no dependence on stem diameter, which was shown to be consistent with the impulse model for sediment entrainment. Existing predictors of bedload transport for bare beds, based on bed shear stress, were recast in terms of turbulence. The new turbulence-based model predicted sediment transport measured in model canopies across a range of conditions drawn from several previous studies. A prediction of turbulence based on biomass and velocity was also described, providing an important step toward predicting turbulence and bedload transport in canopies of real vegetation morphology. © 2021.

       " 'Nature-based solutions to climate change are growing policy priorities yet remain hard to quantify. Here we use remote sensing to quantify direct and indirect benefits from community-led agroforestry by The International Small group and Tree planting program (TIST) in Kenya. Since 2005, TIST-Kenya has incentivised smallholder farmers to plant trees for agricultural benefit and to sequester CO2. We use Landsat-7 satellite imagery to examine the effect on the historically deforested landscape around Mount Kenya. We identify positive greening trends in TIST groves during 2000–2019 relative to the wider landscape. These groves cover 27,198 ha, and a further 27,750 ha of neighbouring agricultural land is also positively influenced by TIST. This positive ‘spill-over’ impact of TIST activity occurs at up to 360\\xa0m distance. TIST also benefits local forests, e.g. through reducing fuelwood and fodder extraction.

       " 'Increasing evidence suggests that agricultural intensification is a threat to many groups of soil biota, but how the impacts of land-use intensity on soil organisms translate into changes in comprehensive soil interaction networks remains unclear. Here for the first time, we use environmental DNA to examine total soil multi-trophic diversity and food web structure for temperate agroecosystems along a gradient of land-use intensity. We tested for response patterns in key properties of the soil food webs in sixteen fields ranging from arable crops to grazed permanent grasslands as part of a long-term management experiment. We found that agricultural intensification drives reductions in trophic group diversity, although taxa richness remained unchanged. Intensification generally reduced the complexity and connectance of soil interaction networks and induced consistent changes in energy pathways, but the magnitude of management-induced changes depended on the variable considered. Average path length (an indicator of food web redundancy and resilience) did not respond to our management intensity gradient. Moreover, turnover of network structure showed little response to increasing management intensity. Our data demonstrates the importance of considering different facets of trophic networks for a clearer understanding of agriculture-biodiversity relationships, with implications for nature-based solutions and sustainable agriculture. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Remediation of groundwater from landfill contamination presents a serious challenge due to the complex mixture of contaminants discharged from landfills. Here, we show the significance of a nature-based solution to a landfill-contaminated aquifer in southeast Norway. Groundwater physicochemical parameters monitored for twenty-eight years were used as a proxy to infer natural remediation. Results show that concentrations of the major chemical variables decreased with time and distance until they tailed off. An exception to this was sulphate, which showed an increase, but apparently, exhibits a stationary phase. The water types were found to be most similar between samples from active landfill and post-closure stages, while samples from the stabilised stage showed a different water type. All the chemical\\xa0parameters of samples from the stabilised stage were found to be within the Norwegian drinking water standards, except iron and manganese, which were only marginally above the limits, an indication of a possible recovery of this aquifer. The findings highlight the significance of natural attenuation processes in remediating contaminated aquifers and have significant consequences for future contamination management, where natural remediation can be viewed as an alternative worth exploring. This is promising in the wake of calls for sustainable remediation management strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'West Papua’s Bintuni Bay is Indonesia’s largest contiguous mangrove block, only second to the world’s largest mangrove in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. As almost 40% of these mangroves are designated production forest, we assessed the effects of commercial logging on forest structure, biomass recovery, and soil carbon stocks and burial in five-year intervals, up to 25\\xa0years post-harvest. Through remote sensing and field surveys, we found that canopy structure and species diversity were gradually enhanced following biomass recovery. Carbon pools preserved in soil were supported by similar rates of carbon burial before and after logging. Our results show that mangrove forest management maintained between 70 and 75% of the total ecosystem carbon stocks, and 15–20% returned to the ecosystem after 15–25\\xa0years. This analysis suggests that mangroves managed through selective logging provide an opportunity for coastal nature-based climate solutions, while provisioning other ecosystem services, including wood and wood products. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Novel heterotrophic bacterial strains—Bzr02 and Str21, effective in nitrogen transformation, were isolated from sequential sedimentation-biofiltration systems (SSBSs). Bzr02, identified as Citrobacter freundii, removed up to 99.0% of N–NH4 and 70.2% of N–NO3, while Str21, identified as Pseudomonas mandelii, removed up to 98.9% of N–NH4 and 87.7% of N–NO3. The key functional genes napA/narG and hao were detected for Bzr02, confirming its ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite and remove hydroxylamine. Str21 was detected with the genes narG, nirS, norB and nosZ, confirming its potential for complete denitrification process. Nitrogen total balance experiments determined that Bzr02 and Str21 incorporated nitrogen into cell biomass (up to 94.7% and 74.7%, respectively), suggesting that nitrogen assimilation was also an important process occurring simultaneously with denitrification. Based on these results, both strains are suitable candidates for improving nutrient removal efficiencies in nature-based solutions such as SSBSs. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Even though agricultural and land sector emissions contribute almost one-quarter of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, it has been a long struggle to properly recognise and discuss within the UNFCCC framework the contribution that these sectors can make to the global mitigation effort. This is despite the fact that many countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions highlight the potential for abatement in these sectors, though commitments are often made contingent on receipt of external finance. A major breakthrough occurred with the adoption of the Koronivia Joint Work Programme on Agriculture at COP23 in 2017. The two UNFCCC subsidiary bodies charged with implementing this work programme will report back on its outcomes at the COP26 in Glasgow in November. The UK government’s Campaign for Nature, under its COP Presidency to highlight the importance of nature-based solutions, can also help to strengthen the focus on the importance of these sectors.

       " 'Some remediation techniques, such as thermal remediation, can significantly change the soil properties. These changes can be beneficial or detrimental to the sequential application of Nature-based Solutions. This work evaluated the effects of thermal remediation on the properties of two tropical soils (Technosol and Oxisol), and discuss how these changes might impact both biotic and abiotic degradation processes. Bench tests using disturbed samples were performed under oxic and anoxic conditions, whereas 3D physical models were used to simulate the heat distribution along undisturbed samples. The changes in soils texture, density, hydraulic conductivity, iron concentration, mineralogy and microbiota were evaluated. The properties of Oxisol were more affected than those of Technosol due to the higher levels in Fe(III), organic carbon and finer texture. When heated in the range of 120 to 300 °C under oxic and anoxic conditions, the Fe(II) content and the magnetism intensity increased in Oxisol, probably due to the formation of magnetite. Under oxic conditions, the burning of Oxisol organic matter promoted an anoxic atmosphere, favoring the formation of Fe(II). However, the continuous increase of the temperature (>300 °C) lead to the decrease of Fe(II) due to the transformation of magnetite to maghemite, and then to hematite. The heating process also promoted some minerals decomposition and cementation of the clay fraction, increasing the soil texture. Bacterial populations were impacted, but showed ability to recover at 60 °C. However, above 100 °C no culturable cells were recovered and at temperatures above 270 °C soil sterilization occurred. The changes observed, especially in Oxisol samples, indicated that mild heating (between 120 and 240 °C), in turn, can increase the potential for abiotic degradation of some contaminants, such as chlorinated solvents. Therefore, heating conditions up to 240 °C during thermal remediation can be defined as to promote beneficial changes in soil properties, increasing its potential for natural attenuation by abiotic processes even when the microbiota is affected, and improving its sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'During the last few decades, the urban hydrological cycle has been strongly modified by the built environment, resulting in fast runoff and increasing the risk of waterlogging. Nature-based solutions (NBSs), which apply green infrastructures, have been more and more widely considered as a sustainable approach for urban storm water management. However, the assessment of NBS performance still requires further modelling development because of hydrological modelling results strongly depend on the representation of the multiscale space variability of both the rainfall and the NBS distributions. Indeed, we initially argue this issue with the help of the multifractal intersection theorem. To illustrate the importance of this question, the spatial heterogeneous distributions of two series of NBS scenarios (porous pavement, rain garden, green roof, and combined) are quantified with the help of their fractal dimension. We point out the consequences of their estimates. Then, a fully distributed and physically based hydrological model (Multi-Hydro) was applied to consider the studied catchment and these NBS scenarios with a spatial resolution of 10 m. A total of two approaches for processing the rainfall data were considered for three rainfall events, namely gridded and catchment averaged. These simulations show that the impact of the spatial variability in rainfall on the uncertainty of peak flow of NBS scenarios ranges from about 8 % to 18 %, which is more significant than those of the total runoff volume. In addition, the spatial variability in the rainfall intensity at the largest rainfall peak responds almost linearly to the uncertainty of the peak flow of NBS scenarios. However, the hydrological responses of NBS scenarios are less affected by the spatial distribution of NBSs. Finally, the intersection of the spatial variability in rainfall and the spatial arrangement of NBSs produces a somewhat significant effect on the peak flow of green roof scenarios and the total runoff volume of combined scenarios. © 2021 Yangzi Qiu et al.',\n",
       " 'Ecohydrology is a transdisciplinary sustainability science based on an understanding of hydrosphere/ecosphere interactions from the molecular to catchment scale, developed within the framework of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme (UNESCO IHP). This paper introduces a broad range of Ecohydrological Nature-Based Solutions (EH-NBS) that have been developed based on dual regulation considering understanding of reciprocal H → B (Hydrogeology → Biocenosis) and B → H interactions. EH-NBS are particularly effective at reducing various dispersed impacts especially non-point source pollution, which generate up to 50% of nutrient pollution load from the catchment. The importance of methodology, integration of ecological and hydrological disciplines which reduces impact and increases landscape water and nutrients retention and freshwater ecosystem resilience which is becoming important element of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) was also presented. Considering the above, implementation of ecohydrology aims to increase catchment sustainability potential, expressed by water, biodiversity, ecosystem services and resilience (WBSR). Due to the specific nature of dispersed impact generated by human factor in the catchment, it is crucial to engage society through culture and education (CE) to ensure the implementation and long-term efficiency. © 2021',\n",
       " 'The global impacts of biodiversity loss and climate change are interlinked, but the feedbacks between them are rarely assessed. Areas with greater tree diversity tend to be more productive, providing a greater carbon sink, and biodiversity loss could reduce these natural carbon sinks. Here, we quantify how tree and shrub species richness could affect biomass production on biome, national and regional scales. We find that GHG mitigation could help maintain tree diversity and thereby avoid a 9–39% reduction in terrestrial primary productivity across different biomes, which could otherwise occur over the next 50 years. Countries that will incur the greatest economic damages from climate change stand to benefit the most from conservation of tree diversity and primary productivity, which contribute to climate change mitigation. Our results emphasize an opportunity for a triple win for climate, biodiversity and society, and highlight that these co-benefits should be the focus of reforestation programmes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.',\n",
       " 'The rewetting of peatlands is regarded as an important nature-based climate solution and intended to reconcile climate protection with the restoration of self-regulating ecosystems that are resistant to climate impacts. Although the severity and frequency of droughts are predicted to increase as a consequence of climate change, it is not well understood whether such extreme events can jeopardize rewetting measures. The goal of this study was to better understand drought effects on vegetation development and the exchange of the two important greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4, especially in rewetted fens. Based on long-term reference records, we investigated anomalies in vegetation dynamics, CH4 emissions, and net CO2 exchange, including the component fluxes of ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), in a rewetted fen during the extreme European summer drought in 2018. Drought-induced vegetation dynamics were derived from remotely sensed data. Since flooding in 2010, the fen was characterized by a patchy mosaic of open-water surfaces and vegetated areas. After years of stagnant vegetation development, drought acted as a trigger event for pioneer species such as Tephroseris palustris and Ranunculus sceleratus to rapidly close persistent vegetation gaps. The massive spread of vegetation assimilated substantial amounts of CO2. In 2018, the annual GEP budget increased by 20 % in comparison to average years (2010 2017). Reco increased even by 40 %, but enhanced photosynthetic CO2 sequestration could compensate for half of the drought-induced increase in respiratory CO2 release. Altogether, the restored fen remained a net CO2 sink in the year of drought, though net CO2 sequestration was lower than in other years. CH4 emissions were 20 % below average on an annual basis, though stronger reduction effects occurred from August onwards, when daily fluxes were 60 % lower than in reference years. Our study reveals an important regulatory mechanism of restored fens to maintain their net CO2 sink function even in extremely dry years. It appears that, in times of more frequent climate extremes, fen restoration can create ecosystems resilient to drought. However, in order to comprehensively assess the mitigation prospects of peatland rewetting as a nature-based climate solution, further research needs to focus on the long-term effects of such extreme events beyond the actual drought period. © 2021 Author(s).',\n",

       " 'Coastal cities are susceptible to the impacts of waves, flooding, storm surge, and sea-level rise. In response to these threats, coastal jurisdictions have invested in engineered shoreline defenses such as breakwaters and sea walls that are costly to implement and maintain. Thus, there is an increasing recognition that nature-based defenses provided by healthy ecosystems like coral reefs can be an effective and cost-efficient alternative to mitigate the impacts of climatic hazards while simultaneously restoring ecosystem services. Unfortunately, coral reefs have experienced degradation worldwide, lowering their potential for wave-energy dissipation. As coastal vulnerability increases with the loss of natural barriers, it is imperative to design and test novel resilience solutions. Our study quantifies the benefits of hybrid artificial reefs for wave mitigation in a wave-tank simulator using periodic waves of three heights (0.10, 0.16, and 0.24 m) at two water levels (0.55 and 0.65 m) defined considering the Froude similarity with a prototype reef structure in South Florida. Experiments showed that an artificial trapezoidal reef model reduces wave height (> 35%) and wave energy (up to 63%) under realistic wave conditions. Moreover, adding coral skeletons of Acropora cervicornis to simulate reef restoration onto the model mitigates up to an additional 10% of wave height and 14% of wave energy through increased friction, supporting the use of hybrid approaches that integrate both gray and green infrastructure to enhance coastal resilience. Exploring wave-tank simulations provides a better understanding of wave effects before implementing larger and more costly projects in the field. © 2020 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography',\n",
       " 'Climate change is expected to lead to more frequent and severe fluvial flood events in Northern Europe. Nature Based Solutions are increasingly recognised as a natural insurance against flood risks in vulnerable areas. This requires collaboration at landscape scale between providers and beneficiaries of flood control. In particular, mechanisms to incentivise owners of land could potentially offer cost-effective ways to reduce damage to urban infrastructure. We conduct a choice experiment among farmers located in the vicinity of a river to assess their willingness to accept a contract that would allow a local Danish municipality to periodically flood farmland to reduce urban flood risks. Results indicate that farmers on average are hesitant about entering into abatement contracts, especially if they have prior experience of crop losses due to extreme weather events. If they were to agree on a contract they would prefer a separate compensation for lost crops; a collective negotiation and higher rather than lower yearly payments. Surprisingly, data did not show a significant preference for or against a requirement to grow flood resistant crops. The results suggest that a contract with a separate damage compensation and based on individual negotiation would on average require an annual payment of 290Euro/ha for farmers with no prior experience of crop losses and 469Euro/ha for farmers who have experienced crop losses.

       " 'Coastal areas are characterized by a high level of risk because of its intrinsic vulnerability to the sea action and the high number of socio-economic activities as well as of marine habitats. Traditional methodologies for the design of coastal defences cannot be applied straightforward in the presence of the effects of climate change because of the need to take into account the non-stationarity of natural processes. A novel approach based on an integrated coastal zone management is required to counteract the main consequences of global warming effects in coastal areas (i.e. sea level rise and the increase in frequency and magnitude of extreme events). In particular, besides institutional measures and preparedness and prevention actions, also structural intervention should be implemented. First of all, the upgrade of existing coastal defence structures should be considered, where this strategy is technically and economically feasible. In addition, it is suggested the realisation of Nature-Based Solutions, which consist on using natural processes to create a resilient system. Finally, the integration of traditional and innovative techniques for the design of coastal defences to realise resilient or, even better, antifragile systems is the most preferable approach. Indeed, perfect knowledge of future conditions is not needed for the design of antifragile systems, since this kind of structures are able to improve themselves when hit by unexpected events. © 2020, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.',\n",
       " \"Is there a trade-off between spending on the green economy and an economy's strength? This paper addresses this question by estimating output multipliers for spending in clean energy and biodiversity conservation, and by comparing these to multipliers of spending on non-ecofriendly energy and land use activities. Using a new international dataset, we arrive at two key results. First, we find that every dollar spent on key carbon-neutral or carbon-sink activities can generate more than a dollar's worth of economic activity, whereas non-green spending returns less than a dollar. Second, for categories of spending where formal comparisons are possible, like renewable versus fossil fuel energy, we find that multipliers on green spending are about twice as large as their non-green counterparts. The point estimates of the multipliers are 1.1–1.7 for renewable energy investment and 0.4–0.7 for fossil fuel energy investment, depending on horizon and specification. These findings survive several robustness checks and lend support to bottom-up analyses that find that stabilizing climate and reversing biodiversity loss go hand in hand with economic prosperity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'Climate change and biodiversity loss are deeply intertwined anthropogenic global crises, for which forests provide powerful nature-based solutions. Biodiverse forests are more resilient to climate change than monocultures, thereby enhancing long-term carbon storage and ecosystem-based adaptation. Awareness of these interdependencies is slowly growing, but we know little about how countries are considering biodiversity within climate policies. Island and low-lying coastal states are particularly vulnerable to climate change and biodiversity loss. Here we assessed if and how the members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) are integrating biodiversity into their national climate action plans through forest-based climate solutions. Our analysis shows that these solutions are a missed opportunity for tackling the twin crises together. Only five of the 39 countries explore co-benefits and synergies between forest-based climate solutions and biodiversity conservation measures. An additional nine mention them separately. Among these 14 countries, only a narrow range of interventions were proposed. While 28 AOSIS members prioritised forests for combating climate change, mostly for mitigation, only three prioritised their unique and globally important biodiversity. This omission is potentially risky, since mitigation measures, such as planting rapidly growing non-native trees, can have negative outcomes for biodiversity. Climate action plans must place a greater emphasis on concrete and measurable targets that create synergies with biodiversity conservation, including through the protection of old-growth forests and forest restoration. Our results highlight that forums such as the United Nations Climate Change Conferences need to continue pushing for a stronger integration of biodiversity into climate policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is one of the most harmful environmental hazards for urban dwellers. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the UHI effect. In this context, the implementation of Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can partially reduce UHI intensity, promoting a resilient urban environment and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation. In order to achieve this result, there is a need to systematically integrate UGI into urban planning and legislation, but this process is subject to the availability of widely applicable, easily accessible and quantitative evidence. To offer a big picture of urban heat intensity and opportunities to mitigate high temperatures, we developed a model that reports the Ecosystem Service (ES) of microclimate regulation of UGI in 601 European cities. The model simulates the temperature difference between a baseline and a no-vegetation scenario, extrapolating the role of UGI in mitigating UHI in different urban contexts. Finally, a practical, quantitative indicator that can be applied by policymakers and city administrations has been elaborated, allowing to estimate the amount of urban vegetation that is needed to cool summer temperatures by a certain degree. UGI is found to cool European cities by 1.07 °C on average, and up to 2.9 °C, but in order to achieve a 1 °C drop in urban temperatures, a tree cover of at least 16% is required. The microclimate regulation ES is mostly dependent on the amount of vegetation inside a city and by transpiration and canopy evaporation. Furthermore, in almost 40% of the countries, more than half of the residing population does not benefit from the microclimate regulation service provided by urban vegetation. Widespread implementation of UGI, in particular in arid regions and cities with insufficient tree cover, is key to ensure healthy urban living conditions for citizens. © 2021',\n",
       " 'Bark beetles can cause epidemic outbreaks and kill millions of cubic meters of economical and ecologically important forests around the world. It is well known what attracts and what repels different species of bark beetle, and these chemical cues can be used to protect trees and catch the beetles without using pesticides. Applying this knowledge, we investigated the use of push–pull strategies with trap logs along susceptible edges of a Swedish boreal spruce forest. The repellents (push) used were non-host volatiles (NHV) attached to tree trunks at the forest edge, and the attractants (pull) was a commercial aggregation pheromone attached to trap logs. The aim was to test whether the Ips typographus catch could be significantly increased by combining a push–pull system with traditional trap logs, thereby providing additional protection. The experiment was performed over two years and included the main flight period of I. typographus. The study sites were clear-cuts that had been harvested the preceding winter, and sun-exposed forest edges of mature spruce were targeted for protection. A full factorial setup was used comprising two treatments (repellent and attractant) and a control. Seven replicates of the trap logs were used, three during the first year and four during the second. The number of established I. typographus maternal galleries per square meter of log surface was used as the response variable. The trap logs captured large numbers of I. typographus, at an average density of 353 and 169 maternal galleries per m2 during year 1 and year 2, respectively, over all treatments. Based on the catch data, with a sufficient number of trap logs, the risk of tree mortality at forest edges may be reduced and we recommend its general use. However, we did not see any significant effect of either the repellent or the attractant on the density of maternal galleries. Hence, we cannot recommend the addition of chemical cues to improve the efficiency of trap logs. Although trap logs are efficient in capturing bark beetles and hence may protect forest edges, it does not imply that they can provide protection on a larger scale. In line with other studies, we hence recommend that forest management to target nature-based solutions that strengthen the resilience of forest stands, by using mixed forest stands and resistant plant species, and nurture habitats for natural predators of I. typographus. © 2021',\n",
       " \"Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) provide a systemic approach to promote the maintenance, enhancement, and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) in urban areas, helping to enhance urban resilience in the water sector. Within the sustainable development goals proposed by UNHABITAT, resilience in cities was established as a critical issue. The assessment of the NBS contribution to urban resilience and the development of tools to determine the long-term value of these solutions comprise a most needed step forward. A comprehensive Resilience Assessment Framework to assess the NBS contribution to urban resilience (RAF), focused on NBS for stormwater management and control, was proposed and developed (Beceiro et al., 2020). This assessment framework aims to support the diagnosis, decision-making, implementation, planning, and management of the NBS and to identify the solutions with greater potential to contribute to city resilience drawbacks. This paper aims to demonstrate the purpose and relevance of the RAF, by presenting its application to a case study, highlighting both data demands (given different complexity requirements for metric's determination) and specific considerations regarding the level of assessment (either to the overall city area or to specific NBS). The application to the case study allows assessing the contribution to urban resilience of the main NBS in the urban area of Porto and, specifically, the contribution of an infiltration basin, which will be implemented in the Asprela catchment. Main resilience shortcomings in the city that may be upgraded by NBS are also identified, as recommendations for future urban planning in Porto. This application also intends to deliver a thorough example for other cities aiming to assess NBS contribution to urban resilience using the proposed RAF. At the city level, the main opportunities to improve the NBS contribution identified corresponded to the Governance and stakeholders' involvement, Environmental resilience and Resilience engaged service. On the other hand, the Social involvement and co-benefits and the Service management (obj.6) are identified as consolidated aspects across the urban area. At the NBS level, it was possible to conclude that the infiltration basin, considering the design characteristics, will enhance significantly the contribution to urban resilience in the Asprela catchment, based on the results for the model based metrics and the defined scenarios. Furthermore, it was possible to conclude that the NBS will operate in overall good hydraulic condition, even for the most severe rainfall conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'Assessing the impacts of urbanization on the inland penetration of sea breeze fronts (SBFs) is an urgent requirement if we are to mainstream nature-based solutions in urban planning of coastal cities. SBFs are vital for the natural ventilation in urban areas. However, the interactions between SBFs and urbanization remain unclear in a mega-river delta, which often undergoes spatiotemporally uneven urban development. This study uses sensitivity experiments to examine the 1990, 2005, and 2016 SBF scenarios from Shanghai, China. We utilized a weather research and forecasting model to evaluate the SBF response to urbanization that incorporated both temporal variability; i.e., different rates of urban expansion and renewal, and spatial variability; i.e., uneven urban growth at various distances from the coastline. Furthermore, the contribution of thermal and aerodynamic factors to the SBF inland penetration was quantitatively separated using multiple regression models, into which dummy variables that measure urbanization-related roughness factors were introduced. The results show that maximum SBF inland penetration distances followed a temporally uneven reduction pattern, with rapid rates of reduction between 1990 and 2005 (4.1–6.3 km/10 yr), and slow rates of reduction between 2005 and 2016 (0.3–2.1 km/10 yr). These distances were also spatially uneven, with SBFs in southeast Shanghai being >10 km deeper than those in the northeast. In addition, the SBF inland penetration models indicate that surface roughness with negative effects, as well as urban heat island and normalized wind direction with positive effects are the three most important controls on penetration distance. These findings suggest that urban planners should therefore account for controlling coastal development, urban renewal measures, and urban ventilation, which could be important contributors to maximizing the role of SBFs in improving the urban environment in a natural way. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",

To investigate the characteristic changes of an exposed substrate after the removal of vegetation, a one-year field experiment was conducted. Substrate properties were comprehensively compared for areas in GR that were planted with Sedum lineare and those with bare substrate. Results show that vegetation cover not only prevented substrate loss by 5.14% (p < 0.05) but also protected the chemical, microbial, and physical properties of the substrate. Moreover, the structure of the substrate changed, as evidenced by a significant increase in fine sand (p < 0.05). The results highlight that attention should be paid to maintaining vegetation cover during GR management. In addition, extensive GRs may not be suitable for fallowing. Once a GR has been established, it needs regular maintenance. Otherwise, the ecological and economic benefits of the GR may be reduced. The findings of the present study can be used to determine the life-cycle costs. Further research should focus on differences in the substrate loss rates, runoff, and temperatures of the substrates under exposure and vegetation cover. The microbial changes after revegetation should also be studied to clarify the role of vegetation in GR ecosystems. The present study provides a reference for improving GR management and ensuring their sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Reforestation is identified as one of the key nature-based solutions to deliver carbon dioxide removal, which will be required to achieve the net zero ambition of the Paris Agreement. However, the potential for sequestration through reforestation is uncertain because climate change is expected to affect the drivers of forest growth. This study used the process-based 3-PG model to investigate the effects of climate change on development of above-ground biomass (AGB), as an indicator of forest growth, in regenerating native forests in southeast Australia. We investigated how changing climate affects AGB, by combining historical data and future climate projections based on 25 global climate models (GCMs) for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. We found that the ensemble means of 25 GCMs indicated an increase in temperature with large variations in projected rainfall. When these changes were applied in 3-PG, we found an increase in the simulated AGB by as much as 25% under a moderate emission scenario. This estimate rose to 51% under a high emission scenario by the end of the 21st century across nine selected sites in southeast Australia. However, when CO2 response was excluded, we found a large decrease in AGB at the nine sites. Our modelling results showed that the modelled response to elevated atmospheric CO2 (the CO2 fertilization effect) was largely responsible for the simulated increase of AGB (%). We found that the estimates of future changes in the AGB were subject to uncertainties originating from climate projections, future emission scenarios, and the assumed response to CO2 fertilization. Such modelling simulation improves understanding of possible climate change impacts on forest growth and the inherent uncertainties in estimating mitigation potential through reforestation, with implications for climate policy in Australia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBSs) enhance the potential for mitigation and adaptation to climate change in cities. Among the environmental benefits offered by these measures, enhanced biodiversity, increased carbon storage, reduction of extreme temperatures, and pluvial flood control are crucial. The purpose of this study was to establish an integrated methodology for quantifying the benefits of NBSs and complementary measures and to apply it in a neighbourhood of Donostia-San Sebastián (Spain), where two alternative designs that incorporated NBSs and complementary measures were designed. Then, the individual effectiveness of the four variables was measured using both in-situ measurements and modelling approaches. For the integrated effectiveness, a multi-criteria decision analysis was employed. Both the ‘feasible’ design and the ‘ideal’ one led to an increase in biodiversity (46 and 108 %, respectively) and carbon storage (50 and 130 %, respectively). When considering each measure independently, putting soil provided the highest benefits for carbon capture and biodiversity; meanwhile, planting woody species and installing light-coloured permeable pavements and water fountains reduced the mean radiant temperature by 26.5 K and the air temperature by 0.5 and 2.5 K, respectively, in specific places. Finally, the importance of quantifying the multiple environmental benefits of NBSs for the selection of climate-smart options in urban planning has been highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'While agricultural issues were almost absent from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in 1992, a window of opportunity opened in favor of their inclusion in the climate agenda during the Conference of the Parties of Durban in 2011. During this period three concepts have emerged in climate agenda-setting: “climate-smart agriculture,” “agroecology,” and “nature-based solutions.” By tracing these three concepts (their origins and scientific and political progressions), we demonstrate that they fostered the “climatisation” of agricultural issues in the late 2000 s. These concepts frame agricultural adaptation and mitigation issues regarding climate change in specific ways. The two concepts of climate-smart agriculture and nature-based solutions are recent, while agroecology is a long-standing term that has recently regained popularity to analyze climate issues. These concepts are promoted by three distinct—and sometimes opposed—epistemic communities and contribute to reviving controversy permeating agricultural debates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'There has been a great deal of interest in recent years in this journal and others in the emerging science and practice of nature-based solutions (NBS) to environmental and climate challenges. Whilst the policy dynamics of these interventions are starting to slowly emerge, less is known about the interface of policy-politics-evidence for NBS. This paper argues that there is a role that public environmental agencies acting as boundary actors can play in the successful brokering of knowledge about NBS into policy. Situated loosely within boundary conceptual approaches, it offers an empirical case study of a UK public boundary agency seeking to broker knowledge about NBS into national policy making forum, which are highly political. The results show that this agency utlises four key tools for navigating ‘the political’ in brokering evidence about NBS into policy: communications and framing, embedding, selectivity, and lobbying. These findings reveal new insights about how public agencies navigate the free market of knowledge production through a four-part tool kit. It concludes by offering suggestions for the wider applicability of the research to the still emerging field of policy for NBS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'This paper explores the concept of “institutional readiness” (IR) applied to the adoption and mainstreaming of Nature-based solutions (NBS) to deal with climate related risks. We argue that barriers towards up-scaling and mainstreaming of NBS are a manifestation of uncertainty, and are often associated with the ‘readiness’ of the institutional setting rather than with the readiness of the NBS technology itself. We align the concepts of Institutional Readiness (IR) to the more widely used concept of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to understand drivers and barriers for adoption of NBS and analyse the role of institutional capacity. We illustrate this with the case study of the Urban Water Buffer Spangen in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, which is an NBS with high TRL. To do so, we constructed a timeline of the design and implementation process of the NBS, identifying and classifying key uncertainties as well as the strategies applied to deal with these uncertainties, particularly in the institutional context. Our results indicate that for mainstreaming of NBS, Institutional Readiness (IR) should be at a degree where strategies to deal with uncertainties in institutional, organizational and governance contexts can be integrated in the design and planning process. We claim that the concept of IR should be considered in its role to deal with uncertainty, in order to close the documented gap of NBS implementation and mainstreaming. © 2021',\n",
       " 'Laboratory experiments and point observations, for instance in wetlands, have shown evidence that microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) can lower sulfate and toxic metal concentrations in acid mine drainage (AMD). We here hypothesize that MSR can impact the fate of AMD in entire catchments. To test this, we developed a sulfur isotope fractionation and mass-balance method, and applied it at multiple locations in the catchment of an abandoned copper mine (Nautanen, northern Sweden). Results showed that MSR caused considerable, catchment-scale immobilization of sulfur corresponding to a retention of 27 ± 15% under unfrozen conditions in the summer season, with local values ranging between 13 ± 10% and 53 ± 18%. Present evidence of extensive MSR in Nautanen, together with previous evidence of local MSR occurring under many different conditions, suggest that field-scale MSR is most likely important also at other AMD sites, where retention of AMD may be enhanced through nature-based solutions. More generally, the developed isotope fractionation analysis scheme provides a relatively simple tool for quantification of spatio-temporal trends in MSR, answering to the emerging need of pollution control from cumulative anthropogenic pressures in the landscape, where strategies taking advantage of MSR can provide viable options. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'The Submerged Artificial sandBar (SAB), recognized as one of the nature-based solutions for beach protection and restoration, has become increasingly popular in coastal engineering applications. However, its morphological response to waves and the resulting impacts on beach evolution are yet not well understood. Here, laboratory experiments are conducted considering different background profiles and various SAB designs. Morphological evolution of the SAB and berm are inspected from the measured beach profile data in the wave flume. Results show that the SAB migrates onshore with its bar shape decaying, providing a paradigm shift away from the traditional understanding that the net subaqueous sediment transport is always offshore directed under storm wave conditions. SAB can alter the beach state and berm behavior by triggering onshore sediment transport locally and temporarily. The stability of the SAB is controlled by its seaward slope and the ratio of crest water depth to the bar height. A morphological coupling is found between the SAB and berm, and an empirical relationship is proposed to quantitatively capture it. Finally, the experiment results are used to validate a process-based beach profile evolution numerical model, and an explanation for the morphological coupling is provided from the perspective of wave energy dissipation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Urban green spaces can provide habitat and resources for urban dwelling fauna. Suburban green spaces occur most commonly as parks and roadside vegetation, but as human populations grow and space in cities becomes increasingly limited, space-efficient green solutions like green roofs and walls in metropolitan areas are becoming increasingly common. However, the efficacy of these forms of green infrastructure in attracting and promoting biodiversity remains limited. To address this, we compared arthropod, gastropod, and avian species richness and diversity between green and conventional roofs on neighbouring and identical buildings in metropolitan Sydney, Australia. By monitoring local biodiversity using motion sensing camera traps and regular insect surveys, we found that the green roof supported four times the avian, over seven times the arthropod, and twice the gastropod diversity of the conventional roof. Only the green roof attracted locally rare species including blue banded bees (Amegilla Cingulata) and metallic shield bugs (Scutiphora pedicellata). Our results suggest that green roofs, like other urban green spaces, can have ecological significance by attracting and supporting urban fauna that may then add important functional capacities to previously depauperate spaces. This study demonstrates the potential for the widespread adoption of green roofs to create more biologically diverse cities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Climate change poses a variety of threats to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human lives. Mangrove forest is one of the key nature-based solutions that address climate change and its impacts while providing socio-economic and ecological services. With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, various national and local governments are considering mangrove rehabilitation as a natural defense to these threats. This study aims to assess the value of mangrove rehabilitation by focusing on the ecological goods and services it provides as well as the cost of the project at different implementation periods. We apply a real options-based trinomial tree model to evaluate the optimal timing of making an investment decision for the rehabilitation project under uncertainty in climate change damage cost. Validating the model using the Philippines as a case, the results found that the economic benefits from the mangrove forest, including the market value of forestry and fishery products, protection from climate-related damages, carbon sequestration, and ecotourism, exceeded the investment cost for the rehabilitation project. Considering the uncertainty in damage costs from natural disasters, the real option valuation gave a higher total investment value which described a more optimal decision to postpone the implementation of the mangrove rehabilitation. However, the results found conditions in the model to invest immediately when the frequency of natural disasters and their associated damage costs significantly increased. The implications of the results recommend government policies to enable the realization of mangrove rehabilitation as a nature-based solution addressing the Paris Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals, and the Disaster Risk Reduction global agendas of transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Planting engineer species is widely used to restore coastal dune ecosystems, but the success of this nature-based practice is often low. Increasing nutrient availability through fertilization and using plant density promoting facilitative plant-plant interactions are increasingly advocated to improve dune restoration. However, how fertilizer application (homogeneous or heterogeneous spatial distribution) influences plant interaction intensity in dune species is still poorly known. We conducted a field-mesocosm experiment assessing the effects of spatial nutrient distribution and planting density on functional traits and intraspecific interactions in two dune plants with contrasting clonal growth architecture. Fragments of Calamagrostis arenaria (phalanx architecture) and Sporobolus virginicus (guerrilla architecture) were grown in monoculture either at low or at high density with the same total supply of fertilizer applied either heterogeneously or homogeneously. We hypothesized that these species would respond differentially to nutrient distribution and plant density. C. arenaria allocated less biomass below- than aboveground under homogeneous than heterogeneous conditions and produced less shoots at low than high density. Conversely, under homogeneous conditions, S. virginicus plants grown at low density had a greater rhizome, root, and total biomass than those at high density. For C. arenaria, intraspecific interactions on aboveground, root, and total biomass shifted from positive to neutral under heterogeneous conditions while those on rhizome biomass switched from neutral to negative. S. virginicus intraspecific interactions on all biomass variables shifted from negative to neutral. Our results demonstrate that nutrient distribution affected functional traits and intraspecific interactions differentially in phalanx and guerrilla species. Notably, in nutrient homogeneous substrates high planting density increased phalanx species performance but reduced that of guerrilla species due to competition. Instead, in heterogeneous substrates both species performed similarly at low and high density. These findings may help restoration practitioners in identifying suitable fertilization/planting schemes and implementing effective dune restoration programs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"Recent findings indicate that plant-root exudates can stimulate plant-associated microorganisms to enhance the biodegradation of contaminants in constructed wetlands. To understand this process, we studied the root-exudation changes of two aquatic plants (Lemna minor and Salvinia natans) upon micropollutants exposure (10, 100 and 1000 μg/L mixes containing naproxen, diclofenac, carbamazepine, and benzotriazole). After a 2-day exposure, plant exudates were collected, extracted and non-target analysis was performed with a gas chromatography–high resolution Orbitrap mass-spectrometer. Plants didn't show morphological or growth differences between the control and spiked reactors, but exudation changes were observed in both plants at all concentration levels. Partial least squares discriminant analysis showed that, for Lemna minor, the increase of micropollutants exposure was linked to the reduction of sugar and fatty acid exudation. This may trigger changes in the microbial community living on complex carbon forms. Instead, in Salvinia natans, micropollutants exposure was linked to the release of long-chain compounds such as cuticular waxes and sesquiterpenoids, which might be related to stress signaling. These results demonstrate that plant micropollutant-exposure at environmentally relevant concentration levels triggers changes in root exudates. This may help to design new strategies to enhance micropollutants degradation in nature based solutions such as in constructed wetlands. © 2021 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) as a sustainable strategy has recently received increasing attention for urban stormwater management. Thus, an evaluation of cost-effectiveness of NBS scenarios by integrating hydrological impacts and life cycle costs is significant for the decision-making process. This study first investigates the hydrological responses of a 5.2 km2 semi-urban watershed under various implementation NBS scenarios and highly spatially variable rainfall fields. The fractal dimension is considered as a scale invariance indicator to quantify the heterogeneous spatial distributions of NBS in each scenario across a range of scales. The hydrological responses of NBS scenarios are assessed by the fully distributed and physically based model (Multi-Hydro) under different rainfall conditions with a high spatial resolution of 10 m. In order to assess the cost-effective NBS scenarios, the hydrologic indicator (reduction of peak flow and total runoff volume) is integrated with the economic indicator (life cycle costs). The results show that the optimal NBS scenarios are characterised with fractal dimension ranges from 1.5 to 1.6 under all studied rainfall events. Considering the NBS scenarios under the strongest rainfall event, concentrating NBS downstream of the catchment can be more cost-effective. This study can provide some guidelines for the decision-making process on sustainable urban planning and improve the flood resilience of cities. © 2021',\n",
       " 'Urban water management has recently been questioned because of the fragmented nature of the urban water system and its linear model. The integration and management of water systems are currently recognized as a socio-technical challenge that must be addressed for a more sustainable urban water management. In the short term, a key factor for its transition will be integration of alternative practices that allow for experimentation, learning, and scaling up. This study aims to identify potential shifts supported by two alternative practices for water reuse: nature-based solutions and water reuse technologies, using circular economy principles as analytical categories. The research uses a case study, the Besòs river of the Barcelona metropolitan area, to show that: i) improving biodiversity and water quality helps to regenerate natural capital; ii) water reuse for streamflow augmentation keeps resources in use and promotes synergies, which benefits social livability; and iii) risk management and a potential fit-to-purpose strategy can marginally help to avoid waste externalities. This research has shown that the CE principles are applicable as a framework for identifying the interconnected shifts promoted by water systems. A reflexive understanding of the alternative practices provides deeper insight into the experiences, barriers, and shifts that allow innovative interactions in specific urban contexts and can deliver additional benefits for society. This knowledge can be useful for integrated urban management; however, further integration of cross-sectoral collaboration and flexibility are required. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Several barriers still hamper the effective implementation of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). Among the others, this work focuses on collaboration barriers. NBS implementation claims for effective collaboration among different decision-agents. However, ambiguity in problem framings, which is ineradicable in multi-agents’ decision environments, could create collaboration barriers. This work aims to demonstrate that collaboration barriers to NBS implementation can be overcome by enhancing the network of interactions among the decision-agents. An innovative method based on the integration between Social Network Analysis and hybrid Agent-Based Model/System Dynamic Model was adopted to this aim. The analysis results were used for designing networking interventions, i.e. efforts using social network characteristics that could enhance interactions mechanisms among decision-agents. The developed method was implemented in the Medina del Campo (Spain) case study. This area is characterised by one of the most critical groundwater bodies of the Duero River Basin. This work aims at supporting the implementation of suitable NBS to stop the degradation of the groundwater status and associated ecosystem services. The activities carried out within the framework of the NAIAD project showed that, by enhancing the interaction mechanisms, ambiguity in problem frames can still yield collective actions for NBS implementation. © 2021 The Authors',\n",

Among NBSs, green walls have been recently studied for several applications, among the others the treatment of lowly polluted wastewater flows as greywater (GW, e.g. domestic wastewater excluding toilet flushes). This work is aimed at the evaluation of the influence of four additives (compost, biochar, granular activated carbon, polyacrylate) mixed with a base filter medium made of coconut fibre and perlite, on the performances of a green wall fed in batch mode with synthetic GW. The green wall was operated with a high hydraulic loading rate of GW (740.8 L/m2/day) in open-air winter conditions (3.5–15 °C measured for GW) between January and April. The performances of the green wall have been assessed though the monitoring every 1–2 weeks of physicochemical and biological parameters (pH, electric conductivity, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, BOD5 and COD, nitrogen and phosporus compounds, chlorides and sulphates, anionic surfactants and E. coli). Removal performances were excellent for BOD5 (&gt;95%) and E.coli (&gt;98%) for all additives; compared to the base medium, biochar was the best performing additive over the highest number of parameters, achieving removals equal to 51% for COD, 47% for TKN and nitric nitrogen and 71% for anionic surfactants. Compost also achieved high removal performances, but the frequent clogging events occurred during the monitoring period do not make its use recommendable. Granular activated carbon and the combination of biochar and polyacrylate performed better than the base medium, but only about the removal of nitric nitrogen. These results demonstrated that, in the considered experimental boundaries, biochar could improve the overall treatment performances of a green wall fed by GW and operated in challenging conditions. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'To help mitigate the impacts of climate change, many nature-based solutions are being explored. These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as ‘Blue Carbon’ ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62–72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (±65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs. The resulting spatially-explicit maps can also be used to pinpoint areas for successful blue carbon projects both now and in the future. © 2021',\n",
       " 'River system retentiveness must be enhanced to increase multidimensional environmental sustainability and thus ameliorate the effects of climate change and the occurrence of extreme hydrological events. The aim of the article is to demonstrate how ecohydrological Nature-Based Solutions can be combined with conventional infrastructure to improve WBSRCE benefits (Water, Biodiversity, ecosystem Services, Resilience, Culture, Education) by taking a holistic approach to multifunctional reservoir design. The paper proposes a new form of lateral reservoir, which is built without disturbing the meandering river and is supplied with good quality water through a monitoring and regulatory system; its design is based on thorough analysis of hydrological pulses and suspended matter and nutrients fluxes. The regulatory system also includes an innovative Sequential Sedimentation and Biofiltration System. Lateral reservoirs increase water retentiveness in the river valley by lifting ground water level and restoring surrounding wetlands, thus enhancing biodiversity, ecosystem services for society and the resilience of the river system to climate change. An integrative understanding of the interplay between hydrology and biocenosis can be used to enhance river system sustainability potential (WBSR) and harmonise societal needs with biosphere sustainability through culture and education (CE). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"The South China Karst (SCK), the world's largest contiguous karst region, has undergone severe ecological degradation associated with the interaction of fragile natural attributes and human activities. Understanding the causes of changes in ecosystem services (ES) is essential to prevent and control ecosystem degradation and support sustainable development. However, existing studies have not comprehensively explored the impact of natural systems and human activities on karst ES and have failed to consider their spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Here, we used regression analysis to study the spatiotemporal evolution of ES in diverse landscapes (karst and non-karst) of SCK and the impact of human activity on them. Random forest regression and geographically weighted regression analysis were used to explore the key factors and driving forces in different landscape ES. The results show that from 1982 to 2018, ES, such as soil conservation (+8.12%), net primary productivity (+21.14%), carbon storage (+0.86%), nitrogen export (−5.89%), and phosphorus export (−1.46%), were improved, mainly due to re-greening and rewilding, which optimizes the structure of the ecosystem. However, large-scale afforestation led to a decrease in water yield (−13.23%). Urban development worsened habitat quality (−0.50%) and biodiversity (−1.91%). With the intensification of human activities, ES in the karst region showed lower maintenance capacity than in non-karst regions. The study found that the driving factors of ES varied with the differing landscapes. Population distribution in the karst region was the biggest threat to ES, whereas farming in the non-karst region was the main ES threat in this region. In these regions, the improvement in vegetation coverage was helpful in plant-carbon sequestration, and the increase of precipitation increased water yield. Importantly, we found that biodiversity maintenance plays a crucial role in ES. Nature-based solutions combined with proper management strategies can counter ecosystem degradation and help achieve sustainable development. © 2021 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Dealing with two major challenges, climate change mitigation and biodiversity loss, under the same management program, is more noteworthy than addressing these two separately. Homegar-dens, a sustainable agroforestry system and a home of diverse species, can be a possible choice to address these two issues. In this study, we assessed tree coverage, and the direct and indirect effects of tree diversity on carbon storage in different carbon pools through stand structure in homegardens of southwestern Bangladesh, using Sentinel 2 and field inventory data from 40 homesteads in eight villages. An unsupervised classification method was followed to assess homegardens’ tree coverage. We found a high tree coverage (24.34% of total area of Dighalia) in homesteads, with a high overall accuracy of 96.52%. The biomass and soil organic carbon (p < 0.05) varied significantly among the eight villages, while total carbon stock did not vary significantly (p > 0.05). Shannon diversity had both direct and indirect effects on biomass carbon, upper layer soil organic carbon and total carbon storage, while basal area mediated the indirect effect. Both basal area and tree height had positive effects on biomass carbon and total carbon storage, with basal area having the strongest effect. These findings suggest that we must maintain higher diversity and tree height in order to maximize and sustain carbon storage, where tree diversity increases stand basal area and improves total carbon storage (including soil organic) in homegardens. Therefore, privately managed homegardens could be a potential nature-based solution for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Exploration of the biodiversity–environmental factors–carbon storage relationships have been a central research question in the changing global climate over the last few decades. However, in comparison to other forest ecosystems, very few studies have been conducted in homegarden agroforestry plantations, which have a tremendous capacity to battle global climate change sustainably. We hypothesized that (i) soil organic matter content has both a direct and indirect effect on aboveground carbon storage through species richness, structural diversity, functional diversity (FD) and functional composition (FC); (ii) some facets of diversity (structural diversity, FD and FC) would be more important in linking species richness to aboveground carbon; (iii) species richness, FC, structural diversity and FD would have a positive impact on aboveground carbon storage (AGC) after considering the effect of soil fertility; and (iv) FC would have a greater effect on AGC than the other three components of biodiversity. These hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling with field data obtained from 40 homesteads in southwestern Bangladesh. We observed that species richness, FC of maximum canopy height and structural diversity had significant effects on AGC, while soil organic matter and FD of wood density had an insignificant effect. Among the four biodiversity components, the structural diversity had a greater influence on AGC. Contrary to our hypothesis, soil fertility and species richness did not have a significant indirect effect on AGC through their mediators. These four components of biodiversity, along with soil organic matter together explained 49% of the variance in AGC. Our findings indicate that both niche complementarity and selection effects regulate AGC in homegardens, where the former theory had stronger control of AGC in homegardens. Therefore, we need to maintain not only the species diversity but also structural diversity (DBH) and functional composition (canopy height) for enhancing aboveground carbon storage on a sustainable basis in homegardens and other restoration programs under nature‐based solution. © 2021 by the authors.

The office visit helped crosscheck the findings, and the field observations carried out between December 2020 and April 2021 asked 24 key informants and collected supplementary information appraisal and indicator development. Of the CCA projects studied, the most (n = 48, 32%) were community-based initiatives, while the least (n = 12, 8%) were ecosystem-based interventions. The main environment-centered projects were Ecosystem-based Adaptations and Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure and Communities (EPIC) while Enhanced Action of Inclusive CSOs for Participation in Climate Resilient Economic Growth (UTHAN), Initiative for CCA (ICCA), Support to Rural Livelihoods and Climate Change Adaptation in the Himalayas (HIMALICA), etc., adaptation projects were community-based. Capacity building and awareness-raising were the major thrust of the CbA projects, while the abatement of climate vulnerabilities and risks through nature-based solutions were priorities of EbA. Payment for Ecosystem services is a nature-based solution that can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change at a local scale by adopting community-based and culturally appropriate methods and enhancing and incentivizing adaptation measures and capacities. A set of 11 criteria and 40 indicators comprised the institutional and behavioral responses and the use of technologies, and the design of climate-resilient plans and climate-smart practices were proposed as appraisal measures to evaluate the success of CCA interventions. The importance of criteria and indicators lies in the fact that such a comprehensive assessment would lead to effective and efficient adaptation projects, which could help benefit beyond the borders. It also furthers ongoing adaptation interventions and is set to be an integral part of associated studies and monitoring and review of new adaptation interventions. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Cities in the 21st century play a major role in the sustainability and climate impact reduction challenges set by the European agenda. As the population of cities grows and their environmental impact becomes more evident, the European strategy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—the main cause of climate change. Measures to reduce the impact of climate change include reducing energy consumption, improving mobility, harnessing resources and renewable energies, integrating nature-based solutions and efficiently managing infrastructure. The monitoring and control of all this activity is essential for its proper functioning. In this context, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a key role in the digitisation, monitoring, and managing of these different verticals. Urban data platforms support cities on extracting Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in their efforts to make better decisions. Cities must be transformed by applying efficient urban planning measures and taking into account not only technological aspects, but also by applying a holistic vision in building solutions where citizens are at the centre. In addition, standardisation of platforms where applications are integrated as one is necessary. This requires interoperability between different verticals. This article presents the information platform developed for the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain. The platform is based on the UNE 178104 standard to provide a holistic architecture that integrates information from the different urban planning measures implemented in the city. The platform was constructed in the context of the SmartEnCity project following the urban transformation strategy established by the city. The article presents the value-added solutions implemented in the platform. These solutions have been developed by applying co-creation techniques in which stakeholders have been involved throughout the process. The platform proposes a step forward towards standardization, harmonises the integration of data from multiple vertical, provides interoperability between services, and simplifies scalability and replicability due to its microservice architecture. © 2021 by the authors.

Furthermore, cocoa agroforestry is one of the most effective nature-based solutions to address global change including land degradation, nutrient depletion, climate change, biodiversity loss, food and nutrition insecurity, and rural poverty and current cocoa supply chain issues. This study was carried out in South-Western Côte d’Ivoire through a household survey to assess the willingness of cocoa farmers to adopt cocoa agroforestry, a key step towards achieving sustainability in the cocoa supply chain markedly threatened by all types of biophysical and socio-economic challenges. In total, 910 cocoa households were randomly selected and individually interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Findings revealed that from the overwhelming proportion of farmers practicing full-sun cocoa farming with little or no companion trees associated, 50.2 to 82.1% were willing to plant and to keep fewer than 20 trees per ha in their farms for more than 20 years after planting. The most preferred trees provide a range of ecosystem services, including timber and food production, as well as shade regulation. More than half of the interviewed households considered keeping in their trees in their plantations for more than 20 years subject to the existence of a formal contract to protect their rights and tree ownership. This opinion is significantly affected by age, gender, access to seedlings of companion trees and financial resources. A bold step forward towards transitioning to cocoa agroforestry and thereby agroecological intensification lies in (i) solving the issue of land tenure and tree ownership by raising awareness about the new forest code and, particularly, the understanding of cocoa agroforestry, (ii) highlighting the added value of trees in cocoa lands, and (iii) facilitating access to improved cocoa companion tree materials and incentives. Trends emerged from this six-year-old study about potential obstacles likely to impede the adoption of agroforestry by cocoa farmers meet the conclusions of several studies recently rolled out in the same region for a sustainable cocoa sector, thereby confirming that not only the relevance of this work but also its contribution to paving the way for the promotion of agroecological transition in cocoa farming. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have been proven to effectively mitigate and solve resource depletion and climate-related challenges in urban areas. The COST (Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action CA17133 entitled “Implementing nature-based solutions (NBS) for building a resourceful circular city” has established seven urban circularity challenges (UCC) that can be addressed effectively with NBS. This paper presents the outcomes of five elucidation workshops with more than 20 European experts from different backgrounds. These international workshops were used to examine the effectiveness of NBS to address UCC and foster NBS implementation towards circular urban water management. A major outcome was the identification of the two most relevant challenges for water resources in urban areas: ‘Restoring and maintaining the water cycle’ (UCC1) and ‘Water and waste treatment, recovery, and reuse’ (UCC2). s Moreover, significant synergies with ‘Nutrient recovery and reuse’, ‘Material recovery and reuse’, ‘Food and biomass production’, ‘Energy efficiency and recovery’, and ‘Building system recovery’ were identified. Additionally, the paper presents real-life case studies to demonstrate how different NBS and supporting units can contribute to the UCC. Finally, a case-based semi-quantitative assessment of the presented NBS was performed. Most notably, this paper identifies the most typically employed NBS that enable processes for UCC1 and UCC2. While current consensus is well established by experts in individual NBS, we presently highlight the potential to address UCC by combining different NBS and synergize enabling processes. This study presents a new paradigm and aims to enhance awareness on the ability of NBS to solve multiple urban circularity issues. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Human activities and natural processes interact with each other in complex ways along the land-sea interface. In order to promote sustainable use of coastal and marine resources, Land-Sea Interactions (LSI) should be taken into account when developing and implementing Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) as required by the MSP Directive (2014/89/EU). Coastal erosion is one of the critical land-sea interaction issues for the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, in particular in its northern part. Erosion can have negative impacts both on marine and coastal environments and on human activities (natural resources, ecosystem services and loss of habitats, with consequent environmental fragmentation, and loss of biodiversity, as well as of landscaping and environmental heritage, impacts on tourism, transport infrastructure, etc.). The present paper provides a detailed investigation with specific focus on coastal erosion driven Land-Sea Interactions as a case study in the Shabla Municipality, North Bulgarian Black Sea coast, where the highest rates of the cliff erosion occur. The study uses the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 5.0, a GIS extension tool for the analysis of shoreline movement (at sandy beaches – erosion/accretion) and cliff retreat (at rocky coasts). The most erosion-prone coastal segments along the cliff coast in the study area were identified (coastal erosion hot spot areas). Through this specific analysis, the paper aims to increase the knowledge and understanding of coastal erosion driven Land-Sea Interactions issues in Shabla Municipality using the best available data, and to utilise the best obtained results in coastal management and Maritime Spatial Planning, towards mitigation measures of coastal erosion impacts. This approach and the tested protocols are also applicable to other coastal change assessments in Bulgaria. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.',\n",
       " 'Nature Based Solutions (NBS), including Natural Flood Management (NFM) schemes are becoming an important component of many governmental and organisation responses to increases in flood and aridity risk. NFM structures may take multiple forms to slow, store, disconnect and filter distributed overland flow pathways within a catchment that coalesce to generate a flood-wave downstream and runoff rather than infiltrate groundwaters. To date few studies have conducted observations pre- and post-installation monitoring at river reach-scales, despite widespread and frequent installation, to investigate the efficacy of willowed engineered log jams (WELJs) interventions used in abating flood-flows, through backing-up flood-pulses with consequent reductions in downstream discharges. This paper examines the efficiency, before and after installation of five 1 m high WELJs incorporating 1,000 Bay willow (Salix pentandra) saplings supporting the dead horizontal timber, across a total of 130 linear metres spanning the floodplain of a decommissioned reservoir. One rain gauge, two fixed point time-lapse wildlife cameras and three water level stations were installed: upstream-of, within, and downstream-of all WELJs. The findings demonstrate a substantial reduction is achieved for most events, with an average of 27.3% reduction in peak discharge being achieved post-installation. The time to peak is little impacted, however there is demonstrable evidence of a longer and higher recessional limb to the events. These findings quantify for the first time the role that WELJs can play in a move towards re-naturalisation of water level regimes, with lower peak water flows achieved, and waters released from the river-reach more slowly. Furthermore, baseflow during dry periods is also elevated by 27.1%, offering greater resilience to dry periods and droughts. Consequently, over the river-reach scale (0–130 m), WELJs play an important role in alleviating flood and drought risk through suppressing flood peaks and increasing baseflow during low flows; steps towards improved hydro-morphological quality overall. © 2021',\n",
       " 'Urban forests are important landscape components in cities around the world that offer multiple functionality, thereby serve as a nature-based solution to offsetting negative social-ecological effects brought by urbanization. While the recreational function, as a traditional focus of urban forests, has been primarily emphasized in Chinese cities, the emerging ecological civilization, as a national guiding institution, has gradually brought ecological dimension into urban forest construction and management. By combining statistical data and satellite image data covering 31 key-cities in mainland China, we attempt to quantitatively analyze the transition of urban forests with regard to two intertwined, critical dimensions: recreational potential (proxied by public park space per capita) and habitat potential (proxied by the percentage of core habitat that is not subject to significant disturbances and thus able to effectively maintain the ecological functionality of urban forest patches), to unveil possible synergies or tradeoffs between these two critical aspects for the period of 2011−2018. We found that overall urban forests’ recreation potential has increased, but their habitat potential has decreased. Economic growth is positively associated with recreation potential, but negatively associated with habitat potential. Results of this study revealed that the institutionalization of “ecological civilization” paradigm in China has not yet been successfully taken into urban forest domain. This calls for urban landscape policy and planning directed towards fostering synergistic effects between urban forests’ recreational function and habitat potential in order to essentially reconcile citizens’ recreational uses and the resilience of cities as complex socioecological systems. In this vein, the development of urban forest, as a visualized form of the mainstream yet subtle ecological civilization, can be further geared towards multi-functionality. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH',\n",

This research is designed in order to explore the influence of NBSs on Green Brand Evangelism (GBE) through mental health, emotional well-being, Green Brand (GB) attitude, and Green Brand Loyalty (GBL) in the hotel industry by considering the moderating effect of price fairness. Our theoretical model was built based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory, which successfully embraces the NBS framework, GBL, and GBE. Our findings based on an online survey reveal that NBS as a second-order construct, which embraces the four first-order elements, significantly improves guests' perception of mental health and emotional well-being. The direct and indirect effects of mental health, emotional well-being, GB attitude, and GBL also uncovered and significantly impacted GBE. The hypotheses were generally supported.

       " \"Species that depend on anthropogenic waste for food can remove pathogens that pose health risks to humans and livestock, thereby saving lives and money. Quantifying these benefits is rare, yet can lead to innovative conservation solutions. To assess these benefits, we examined the feeding ecology and population size of peri-urban spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta in Mekelle, Ethiopia. We integrated these field data into a disease transmission model to predict: (a) the number of anthrax and bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infections arising in humans and livestock from infected carcass waste and (b) the costs associated with treating these infections and losing livestock. We compared these public health and economic outcomes under two scenarios: (a) hyenas are present and (b) the counterfactual, hyenas are absent. We estimated that hyenas annually remove 4.2% (207 tonnes) of the total carcass waste disposed of by residents and businesses in Mekelle. Furthermore, the scavenging behaviour of hyenas annually prevents five infections of anthrax and bTB in humans, and 140 infections in cattle, sheep and goats. This disease control service potentially saves USD 52,165 due to the treatment costs and livestock loss avoided. Synthesis and applications. This human–hyena interaction in Ethiopia is evidence that large carnivores can contribute to human health and economy. To retain these benefits and maintain tolerance of hyenas, we recommend introducing education programmes to promote safe outdoor behaviour around hyenas, training watchdogs to alert residents of hyena presence, constructing bomas to protect livestock from hyena attacks, and preserving the hyenas' access to carcass waste to reduce their dependency on livestock predation. With humans and carnivores coming more frequently into contact, understanding and communicating how these species can benefit humanity will be critical to motivating human–carnivore coexistence worldwide. © 2021 The Authors.

       " 'Sponge City (SC) projects aim to replicate natural water cycles within urban settings, providing sustainable solutions to urban water management. However, there is a lack of understanding on the relative importance and performance of the significant factors that contribute to the success of SC projects. To address this, we conducted a survey of urban water experts from the two distinctive cultures of Australia and China, to generate insights on ‘what makes a successful Sponge City project?’. We also explored the relationships between success factors using importance performance analysis and structural equation modelling. Our findings demonstrate that whilst professionals think that the water management objectives have been dealt with in a satisfactory way, they also find that economic, socio-cultural and design factors are addressed in an insufficient or fragmented way. Our research highlights both similarities and differences in the importance and performance of SC factors in two countries. In China greater attention to economic factors is required, while in Australia policy and governance factors require greater focus. Both China and Australia would benefit from further research on undervalued socio-cultural factors. Most importantly we find that SC projects require greater integration of substantive and procedural factors to address urban water challenges. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'The evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of Payments for ecosystem services (PES) in fostering positive environmental outcomes has been central to the scientific debate on their implementation. PES cost-effectiveness can be affected by a myriad of environmental, institutional and socio-economic factors operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, it can be affected by synergies and trade-offs in the provision of ecosystem services (ES). Planting trees is increasingly considered an effective measure to provide water-related ES. It can enhance watershed services such as nutrient retention, erosion control, stream flow regulation, protection against extreme events (e.g., floods and landslides), and lead to a permanent change in land use, replacing agricultural activities that give rise to diffuse pollution. Very few studies currently exist on the cost-effectiveness of tree planting for water quality benefits PES schemes in Europe. Including both review and research elements, this paper highlights challenges in undertaking such assessments. It develops a conceptual framework to help underpin future studies, with its application to three case studies in Denmark explored. Particular attention is given to the estimation of environmental effectiveness in the provision of water quality services and the importance of co-benefits. In the case where we exclude co-benefits from the analysis, the financial cost-effectiveness is always above zero, with central estimates (without discounting environmental improvements) of €10/Kg N, and €0.36 to €0.50/mg pesticide. Once co-benefits are accounted for, however, the social cost-effectiveness is negative (except for under the low estimates) as the value of the co-benefits exceeds the costs, with central estimates of -€28/Kg N, and -€0.34 to -€0.23/mg pesticide. The paper discusses the implications and lessons for PES cost-effectiveness analysis, and identifies research gaps. Increased knowledge of forest water benefits and the cost-effectiveness of woodlands for water schemes would help underpin future incentives to enhance the provision of these ES. © 2021',\n",
       " 'Restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems is essential to meet both national and global conservation targets and to counteract declines in coastal marine ecosystems. However, despite its status as a world leader in marine protection, Australia is lagging behind other countries in the implementation of coastal and marine restoration. Effective legislative frameworks that support the implementation of coastal and marine restoration as a management tool remains a key barrier to large-scale implementation of coastal and marine restoration in Australia and many other regions. We analyzed restoration projects and their policy frameworks in Australia, North America and Europe to identify the range of policy approaches for marine and coastal restoration. We then evaluated the legislative frameworks for coastal and marine restoration in two states in Australia (Queensland and New South Wales), to assess the current restoration permitting process and identify how different legislative and policy approaches could facilitate coastal and marine restoration projects. We identified two specific areas where improvements could be made to facilitate marine coastal restoration in Australia: increased transparency and better integration into coastal policy. Coastal and marine restoration in Australia is undertaken without appropriate and effective policy at the local, regional and national levels, which likely impedes its broader use as a management strategy. The policy and legislative changes and amendments outlined in this article can streamline the coastal and marine restoration process and thereby improve uptake of marine and coastal restoration in Australia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"Finding solutions for the careful management of our natural heritage is fundamental to sustaining humanity on the planet. In this sense, nature-based solutions (NBS), which are useful initiatives aimed at addressing socio-environmental challenges to achieve a relatively more natural environment, can be a fundamental tool for reaching this goal in an urban context. However, there is no evidence that having NBS in urban cities could attract the young generations. The present study investigates Generation Z's interest in NBS and explores the possibility of them considering a city that offers NBS as a possible tourism destination. This study uses different NBS initiatives implemented in the metropolitan area of Turin. Using quantitative approaches to qualitative responses, that is, multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, a hierarchical cluster structure was designed and gradually explored to identify main groups of respondents and subsequently deeper partitions. The results show that Generation Z perceives NBS initiatives as important for safeguarding and enhancing the cultural and natural heritage of the urban areas involved, which can improve their touristic and leisure value. This study is particularly relevant since it can help institutions to consider a new approach to stimulating proximity tourism in urban cities and their surroundings, by valorizing NBS as a possible attraction for Generation Z. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Urban green spaces have the reputation of limited potential to support biodiversity and public places located in urbanized regions normally sustain low levels of biodiversity. But there is the potential to improve such characteristics using restoration techniques that are easily implemented and cost-effective. In this study we implemented a set of nature-based interventions aiming to boost the local biodiversity of three urban parks in Sorocaba, SP, Brazil. Our interventions were designed to induce local ecological succession. In each park, we prepared nine sampling units (SU) by removing grass in a circle of 1 m diameter each. During the period of the study, three Sus in each park were kept uncovered (control treatment), three received -forest litter collected in an adjacent, well-conserved forest fragment (transposition treatment), and in the other three SUs, we installed a perch (perch treatment). For one year following establishment of the treatment, we monitored each SU biweekly and recorded the number and identity of seedlings that germinated in the circles. We recorded fluctuations in the number of seedlings in all experimental treatments of the three parks, indicating the variable rate of survivorship among species. We recorded a total of 30 different genera, most of which were herbaceous plants of species native to the region. In terms of the category of seed dispersion syndrome, most seedlings were from species dispersed by abiochoric vectors. Asteraceae was the most common botanical family. On one hand, if the experimental techniques we tested did not achieve the expected success in terms of the number of species of shrubs and trees, on the other hand, such interventions were not harmful in that they did not result in a predominance of exotic species. We conclude that this kind of approach has the potential to be successfully implemented in urban green spaces due to the simplicity of elaboration and implementation, respect of the natural structure and functioning (it is a nature-based alternative), and with an appropriate cost-benefit. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Urban green infrastructure (GI) such as biofiltration systems (also known as bioretention, biofilters, rain gardens) are being increasingly implemented in different parts of the world to enhance urban greening whilst controlling stormwater pollution. Treatment effectiveness has been shown to be reliant upon the surrounding climate, including rainfall patterns (e.g. length of wet and dry weather) and temperature. Plant species play a key role in treatment, yet, the response of different plant species to pollutant removal under different climatic and environmental conditions is still not fully known. This information is pertinent to ensure sustained biofilter performance under a range of conditions. This study investigates the change in biofilter nutrient and E. coli removal performance in the presence of four plant species (Canna indica, Carex appressa, Ginkgo biloba and Miscanthus sinensis) with distinct above and below ground characteristics, when exposed to wet weather, dry weather and cold weather conditions. The extent of the decline in nutrient treatment performance following extended drying and under cold conditions was found to be species-specific. Miscanthus sinensis was the best performer and was also found to be cold-resistant. With the exception of Miscanthus sinensis, all plant species were more impacted by the cold temperature (decrease from 70% to 45% TN removal on average; <1 to 30% decrease across species) compared to 4-weeks drying (decrease from 60% to 54% TN removal on average; <1–16% decrease across species) in systems equipped with a submerged zone. In contrast, the 4-weeks drying (E. coli decrease from 2.60 to 1.08 log removal on average) had a more pronounced effect on E. coli removal performance compared to the cold conditions (E. coli decrease from 1.70 to 1.38 log removal on average). This study shows that plant species relative contribution to pollutant removal is pollutant-specific and varies under different climatic conditions. A mix of plant species may ensure higher level of system resilience under a variable climate. The study also highlights the need to understand more about the microbial ecology of these plant systems to optimise both nutrient and pathogen removal for sustained long term performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Second, they were used as inputs in Envi-Met model to simulate eight scenarios with different type and ratio of vegetation and different water bodies configurations. The findings indicate that the thermal comfort level could be improved by means of two solutions; increasing the vegetation ratio with respect of the air flow and increasing water surfaces within the outdoor space.

       " 'Understating of forest functioning is crucial for ensuring the sustainable flow of forest ecosystem services. Climate regulation service of a forest ecosystem can be ensured through emission reduction by increasing carbon sequestration in forests. However, understanding about the functioning of forests for carbon sequestration is constrained due to lack of information on nutrient stocks and stoichiometry of soils of forests of India. Present study focuses to examine the stoichiometry of major nutrients; nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), carbon (C) of forest soil to understand the dynamics of the forests of Uttarakhand, India. The study also attempted to supplement the information about the soil carbon sequestration potential of important tree species of the forest. Soil samples were collected randomly for the evaluation of physico-chemical characteristics and stoichiometry of forest soil at four altitudinal ranges i.e., &lt;1000, 1000–1500, 1500–2000, and &gt;2000 m a.s.l in the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. The analysis shows that total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and soil organic carbon contents in forest soil were 0.35 ± 0.11%, 0.10 ± 0.04% and 3.36 ± 0.84%, respectively, which increases with altitude. The stoichiometric ratios viz., C:N:P, N:P, C:N, and C:P, and N:P were reported of 51.6:5.4:1, 4.30 ± 2.39, 9.60 ± 1.48, and 41.94 ± 23.35, respectively which were invariant with altitude. The low C:N ratio may be attributed to either increase in the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions with an increase in nitrogen, or low in carbon stock leading to decrease in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions. Moreover, the soil C sequestration potential in the forest tree species follow the order of Abies pindrow &gt; Cedrus deodara &gt; Quercus leucotrichophora &gt; Pinus roxburghii. The information of the study would facilitate for broadening the understanding about the soil properties and stoichiometry of forest ecosystem and would provide an aid to forest management besides contributing to the mitigations strategies of the forests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Citizens’ involvement can positively contribute to foster resilience for mitigating the impact of climate change. Successful integration of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) into the urban fabric enables both the mitigation of climate hazards and positive reactions of citizens. This paper presents two case studies in a southern district of Milan (Italy), investigating the emotional reaction of citizens to existing urban greenery and designed NBS. During the events, the participants explored in Virtual Reality (VR) (n = 48) and Augmented Reality (AR) (n = 63) (i) the district in its current condition and (ii) the design project of a future transformation including NBS. The environmental exploration and the data collection took place through the exp-EIA© method, integrated into the mobile app City Sense. The correlations between the color features of the viewed landscape and the emotional reaction of participants showed that weighted saturation of green and lime colors reduced the unpleasantness both in VR and AR, while the lime pixel area (%) reduced the unpleasantness only in VR. No effects were observed on the Arousal and Sleepiness factors. The effects show high reliability between VR and AR for some of the variables.

       " \"Plants, especially trees, provide ecological functions but may harm the flood conveyance efficiency of rivers. Understanding the impacts of tree heights, tree areas, and tree locations on flood levels is crucial for floodplain management. This study aims to present a methodology to improve the performance of hydrodynamic modeling by considering plant resistance with the goal of analyzing flood risk reduction strategies that support ecological conservation enhancement. An unmanned aerial vehicle was used to collect floodplain topography, landcover, and tree characteristic data. A modified maximum likelihood classification scheme was developed by incorporating the tree height information to improve the landcover classification. The water-blocking effect of trees, which represents the reduced flood conveyance area, was investigated by establishing tree obstructions in hydrodynamic models. Two hydrodynamic models were established with different tree obstruction setups and Manning's n values, including blocked obstructions (BOs) and conventional high n-values (Adj-n). Among the model setups, the Manning's n values of the trees remained the same as that of the soil in the BO model, in which trees were modeled as blocking obstructions. The n-values of trees were determined to be 0.022 in the BO model and refined to 0.055 in the Adj-n model after the model calibration and verification processes. The results indicated that the simulated flood levels of the BO model were very similar to those of the Adj-n model. The NSE values were 0.98 and 0.97 in the simulations of two historical typhoon events, indicating that the BO model could obtain reliable predictions without altering the n-values. The verified BO model was used to evaluate the degrees of influence of tree heights, tree coverage areas, and tree locations on flood levels. Several nature-based solutions were proposed to analyze the tradeoffs between reducing flood prevention and enhancing wetland restoration using the verified BO model, suggesting a win–win strategy for natural river management. © 2021 The Authors.

       " 'Deltas are among the most productive and diverse global ecosystems. However, these regions are highly vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change. Nature-based solutions (Nbs) have been increasingly adopted in many deltas to improve their resilience. Among decision support tools, assessment of ecosystem services (ES) through spatially explicit modelling plays an important role in advocating for Nbs. This study explores the use of the Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator (LUCI) model, a high-resolution model originally developed in temperate hill country regions, to map changes in multiple ecosystem services (ES), along with their synergies and trade-offs, between 2010 and 2018 in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). In so doing, this study contributes to the current knowledge in at least two aspects: high-resolution ES modelling in the VMD, and the combination of ES biophysical and economic values within the VMD to support Nbs implementation. To date, this is the highest resolution (5 by 5 m) ES modelling study ever conducted in the VMD, with ~1500 million elements generated per ES. In the process of trialling implementations of LUCI within the VMD’s unique environmental conditions and data contexts, we identify and suggest potential model enhancements to make the LUCI model more applicable to the VMD as well as other tropical deltaic regions. LUCI generated informative results in much of the VMD for the selected ES (flood mitigation, agriculture/aquaculture productivity, and climate regulation), but challenges arose around its application to a new agro-hydrological regime. To address these challenges, parameterising LUCI and reconceptualising some of the model’s mechanisms to specifically account for the productivity and flood mitigation capability of water-tolerant crops as well as flooding processes of deltaic regions will improve future ES modelling in tropical deltaic areas. The ES maps showed the spatial heterogeneity of ES across the VMD. Next, to at least somewhat account for the economic drivers which need to be considered alongside biophysical valuations for practical implementations of ES maps for nature-based solutions (Nbs) in the upstream VMD, economic values were assigned to different parcels using a benefit transfer approach. The spatially explicit ES economic value maps can inform the design of financing incentives for Nbs. The results and related work can be used to support the establishment of Nbs that ultimately contribute to the security of local farmers’ livelihoods and the sustainability of the VMD. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Participation and citizen engagement are fundamental elements in urban regeneration and in the deployment of nature-based solutions (NBS) to advance sustainable urban development. Various limitations inherent to participatory processes concerning NBS for inclusive urban regeneration have been addressed, and lessons have been learnt. This paper investigates participation and urban regeneration and focuses on the development of guidelines for citizen engagement and the co-creation of NBS in the H2020 URBiNAT project. The methodology first involves the collection of scientific and practical input on citizen engagement from a variety of stakeholders, such as researchers and practitioners, to constitute a corpus of qualitative data. This input is then systematized into guideline categories and serves as the basis for a deeper analysis with researchers, experts, and practitioners, both inside and outside URBiNAT, and in dialogue with other cases of participatory NBS implementation. The results highlight an ‘ecology of knowledges’ based on a ‘living’ framework, which aims to address the specific needs of various segments of citizens and to match citizen engagement to the participatory cultures of cities. Implications and further research are also discussed, with a special focus on the implementation of NBS. The conclusions broaden the research context to include the refinement of the NBS approach, with participation being seen as both a means and an end. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Emergent macrophyte species selection is critical for the effectiveness of nature-based engineered solutions aiming to address excess nutrient concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. Yet, the mechanisms with which macrophytes enhance nutrient retention need to be further understood. Here, we compared nutrient retention among 12 artificial flumes fed with effluents from a wastewater treatment plant and subjected to four treatments: absence of macrophytes (control) and presence of three different macrophyte species (Iris pseudacorus L., Phragmites australis L., and Schoenoplectus lacustris L.). We estimated the net and gross nutrient uptake based on the longitudinal profiles of ambient concentrations and on pulse injections of ammonium (NH4+) and soluble reactive phosphorus. Further, we investigated the influence of subsurface hydrological retention, attributed to the architectural differences in the roots of these macrophytes, on nutrient retention. Results showed a species-specific effect of macrophytes on nutrient retention and confirmed root-associated subsurface hydrological retention as a driving factor. Schoenoplectus showed both high net and gross NH4+ uptake, thereby being the most effective species to address N loading, compared to Iris and Phragmites. This work contributes to improve our mechanistic understanding of the role of emergent macrophytes on nutrient retention in aquatic environments. ©',\n",
       " 'Background: With a lack of United States federal policy to address climate change, cities, the private sector, and universities have shouldered much of the work to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions. This study aims to determine how landcover characteristics influence the amount of carbon\\xa0(C) sequestered and respired via biological processes, evaluating the role of land management on the overall C budget of an urban university. Boston University published a comprehensive Climate Action Plan in 2017 with the goal of achieving C neutrality by 2040. In this study, we digitized and discretized each of Boston University’s three urban campuses into landcover types, with C sequestration and respiration rates measured and scaled to provide a University-wide estimate of biogenic C fluxes within the broader context of total University emissions. Results: Each of Boston University’s three highly urban campuses were net sources of biogenic C to the atmosphere. While trees were estimated to sequester 0.6 ± 0.2\\xa0kg C m−2 canopy cover year−1, mulch and lawn areas in 2018 emitted C at rates of 1.7 ± 0.4\\xa0kg C m−2\\xa0year−1 and 1.4 ± 0.4\\xa0kg C m−2\\xa0year−1, respectively. C uptake by tree canopy cover, which can spatially overlap lawn and mulched landcovers, was not large enough to offset biogenic emissions. The proportion of biogenic emissions to Scope 1 anthropogenic emissions on each campus varied from 0.5% to 2%, and depended primarily on the total anthropogenic emissions on each campus. Conclusions: Our study quantifies the role of urban landcover in local C budgets, offering insights on how landscaping management strategies—such as decreasing mulch application rates and expanding tree canopy extent—can assist universities in minimizing biogenic C emissions and even potentially creating a small biogenic C sink. Although biogenic C fluxes represent a small fraction of overall anthropogenic emissions on urban university campuses, these biogenic fluxes are under active management by the university and should be included in climate action plans. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",

The research is framed within design science research, and the theoretical definition of the model was followed by its application to the International Hub for Sustainable Development (HIDS) proposed by the University of Campinas, Brazil. The modelʹs parameters and indicators derive from a literature review, case studies, and GIS spatial analyses. A series of expert workshops and a survey were carried out to test and validate the model. The results show that the model can support knowledge‐based development in peri‐urban areas with high levels of population density while ensuring good accessibility to green spaces and productive landscapes. The model can serve as a planning and design tool and support the development of public policies for other contexts committed to more resilient and sustainable development. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Road runoff carries a mixture of contaminants that threatens the quality of natural water bodies and the health of aquatic organisms. The use of sedimentation ponds is a nature-based solution for the treatment of road runoff. This study assessed the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated homologues in sediment from seven highway sedimentation ponds and three natural urban ponds. In addition, the study explored the bioaccumulation of PAHs in dragonfly nymphs (Anisoptera). Finally, biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) were estimated. The results revealed a significant difference in the concentrations of 16 priority PAHs in sediment, with overall higher levels in sedimentation ponds (2,911\\xa0µg/kg on average) compared to natural urban ponds (606\\xa0µg/kg on average). PAH levels increased substantially once alkylated homologues were considered, with alkylated comprising between 42 and 87% of the total PAH in sediment samples. These results demonstrate the importance of alkylated forms in the environmental assessment of PAHs. The bioaccumulation assessment indicates that dragonfly nymphs bioaccumulate PAHs to a certain degree. It is not clear, however, whether they metabolize PAHs. BSAF results ranged from approx. 0.006 to 10 and indicate that BSAFs can be a powerful tool to determine the functionality of sedimentation ponds. © 2020, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Coastal areas in developing countries are very vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise. Adaptation to sea-level rise through protection measures can include both engineering and nature-based solutions. However, comparative economic analyses across both types of solutions are sparse. Moreover, stated preference studies in developing countries that are commonly applied to estimate the benefits of adaptation projects increasingly include time payments as an alternative to money payments. The implications of this payment mode on policy recommendations remains unclear. In this study, we conduct cost-benefit analyses (CBA) that incorporate the results of discrete choice experiments with money as well as time payments for both an engineering (groynes) and a nature-based (beach nourishment) solution. We provide a range of sensitivity analyses regarding discount rates, effectiveness of the measures, cost estimates and different projections in the benefit calculations. These quantitative CBAs are complemented by qualitative insights from focus group discussions. We find overall negative net present values of both engineering and nature-based erosion solutions when money payments are applied, but positive values when time payments are applied. Qualitative insights describe the disruptive effects of erosion on local livelihoods. The qualitative results combined with previous studies’ results provide support for the use of the time payment results. Furthermore, our results indicate that nourishment has a larger positive effect on welfare than groynes. These results provide relevant insights for decision-makers regarding coastal adaptation and stated preference practitioners in developing countries regarding the use of time payments. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Greywater treatment and reuse for non-potable purposes in urban areas has become a widely researched topic to reduce the burden on fresh water resources. This study reports on the use of a green wall for treating grey water and reusing the effluent for toilet flushing, called Total Value Wall (TVW). Initially, the effectiveness of (mixtures of) different substrates, i.e. lava, lightweight expanded clay aggregates, organic soil and biochar was investigated by means of column tests. All substrates were first examined for hydraulic characteristics and later on the columns were fed with synthetic grey wastewater and followed up in terms of removal efficiency of COD and detergents. The mixture consisting of lava (50%), organic soil (25%) and biochar (25%) proved to be optimal both in terms of percolation rates and removal efficiencies, and was thus selected for the full-scale system. The full-scale TVW of 14.4 m2 was installed at a terraced house in Ghent (Belgium), and was loaded with grey water at 100 L per day. Influent and effluent quality were routinely monitored by grab sampling, water savings were monitored by means of flow meters, and electricity consumption was also accounted for. The TVW was further equipped with sensors that measure temperature, Particulate Matter (PM10) and CO2 in the air. The full-scale system obtained effluent concentrations of 13 mg.L−1 TSS, 91 mg.L−1 COD and 5 mg.L−1 BOD5. Ammonium and total coliforms were removed with removal rates of 97% and 99% (2 log units) respectively. However, an increase in effluent concentration of nitrate and phosphate was observed due to leaching from the selected substrate. Available data from the temperature sensors have clearly demonstrated the additional benefit of the TVW as an insulating layer, keeping the heat outside on warmer days, and keeping the heat inside on colder days. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TVW is a sustainable system for greywater treatment and reuse. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"The concept of nature-based solutions (NBSs) has become increasingly popular among urban policymakers and planners to help them tackle the urban challenges arising from urban expansion and climate change. Stakeholders' involvement is a fundamental step, and stakeholders' perceptions and preferences can affect the development of NBS projects. This study aims to identify stakeholders' perceptions of the most critical urban challenges, the priority interventions, the preferred NBSs and the benefits of the NBSs, and to identify the determinants of these perceptions. A survey was administered to assess stakeholders' perceptions and views on implementing NBSs in two Portuguese cities with distinct urban, geographical, and socio-economic contexts. A binary logistic regression model was used to understand the determinants of the likelihood of the stakeholders’ answers. According to the stakeholders, climate change is one of the main concerns in the urban context. It is usually associated with the incidence of heatwaves and water scarcity. Additionally, stakeholders are concerned about the low quantity and poor management of green spaces (GSs). They believe that it will be necessary to increase the GS, to recover some degraded areas, and to increase mobility. The preferred NBSs were planting more urban trees, making green shaded areas, and rehabilitating riverbanks. The main expected benefits were benefits for leisure and relaxation, reductions in air temperature, purer air, and improvements in public health. The results showed mostly coherent connections between the main concerns/priorities of the stakeholders and the perceived NBS benefits; however, some stakeholders did not present coherent connections, indicating low awareness of the current policy for implementing NBSs to overcome existing and future urban challenges. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Indigenous agroforestry systems are important reservoirs of biodiversity, and ecosystem services with a potential contribution for conservation of biodiversity while sustaining the livelihood of the rural populace. Pineapple (Ananas comosus) agroforestry systems (PAFS) form an essential constituent of the rural landscape in the Indian Eastern Himalayas and other parts of Asia. The traditional PAFS management in southern Assam is unique in that it involves shifting cultivation transitioning from native forests to a PAFS. Scarcity of information on the functioning and services in terms of species diversity and carbon storage potential in the traditional PAFS has restricted the opportunities for consideration under the nature-based solutions of climate action including REDD+. Therefore, the present study assessed the tree diversity and ecosystem carbon storage in a chronosequence from swidden agriculture through different phases of PAFS establishment. The result demonstrated that basal area in the PAFS increased with age. The most dominant species in the native forests was Palaquium polyanthum, while agricultural land use and PAFS aged &lt;5, 11–15 and &gt; 15 years old were dominated by Gmelina arborea, Albizia procera, Areca catechu and Hevea brasiliensis, respectively. The highest value of Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) was recorded in native forests (2.71), and lowest in 5–10 years old PAFS. The ecosystem carbon storage declined from 261.43 Mg ha−1 in native forests to 181.07 Mg ha−1 in &lt;5-years old PAFS. In &lt;5 years old PAFS, the ecosystem carbon storage was 30 % lower than the native forest; while at &gt;15 years it was merely 5 % less than the native forests. The traditional PAFS maintains a steady ecosystem carbon stock while reducing land use related carbon emission and providing additional co-benefits to the communities. Therefore, the traditional PAFS constitute a good opportunity for REDD+. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"The formulation of management plans as required by EU environmental policies such as the Floods Directive may facilitate the uptake of nature-based solutions (NBS) into practice. Previous research has indicated that the uptake of NBS in water management plans is still low and hindered by various elements of the existing water governance system. However, research so far neglected the role of water managers as “plan-makers” of solution strategies and programs of measures, as well as their beliefs in choosing certain measures in the plan-making process. The aim of this study is to shed more light on the plan-makers' reasoning for integrating, or not integrating, NBS into specific flood risk management plans (FRMPs). We conducted ten qualitative interviews with plan-makers from Germany and adopted a grounded theory approach to identify their beliefs that underlie the process of formulating FRMPs as well as their perceived role in this process. The analysis reveals a dominance of shared substantive and relational beliefs that are obstructive to a greater uptake of NBS in FRMPs. In particular, identified beliefs about NBS often do not align with their self-perception of their role in being the “plan-makers”. We present a differentiated portrait of water managers as key actors in the decision-making on FRMPs, illustrating that while water managers are belonging to the same distinct professional group with a similar social role in the decision-making process, they do not necessarily share the same preferences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'The growing environmental awareness of society, the advancement of nature-based solutions (NbSs), and the need for reliable and cost-effective solutions create a favorable environment of opportunities for floating wetlands as alternative solutions for marine water pollution control. The aim of this work was to screen, through OpenLCA, the environmental impacts of floating wetlands for marine water pollution control at various life cycle stages of the system, and assess its economic performance and contribution to the welfare of society. The stage of raw materials production and acquisition was found to be responsible for the main environmental impacts of the floating wetlands, especially on global warming potential, whereas the main impact of the operational stage was related to the eutrophication potential due to N and P residuals in the effluent. The economic performance indicators of economic net present value (ENPV), economic rate of return (ERR), and benefits/costs ratio (B/C ratio) indicate, although marginally, that floating wetlands may constitute a viable investment with potential positive socioeconomic impacts. However, there are still several scientific challenges and technical issues to be considered for the operational application of such systems at full-scale in marine environments. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The Paiva River is considered one of the least polluted rivers in Europe and its watershed has a high conservation value. However, the Paiva River basin suffers pressures related with recurrent disturbances in land use, such as forest fires, agricultural activities, urbanization and pressures that affect the natural hydromorphological conditions and the continuity of watercourses. Blue and Green Infrastructures (BGINs) emerge to improve biodiversity, sustainability and the supply of ecosystem services while improving socioeconomic aspects. Thus, this article aims to identify priority areas in the basin, for intervention with these infrastructures. For that, a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (MDCA) was carried out according to several data related to the Paiva River Basin. As local politicians and responsible entities for the natural resources management are the main experts on the problems and their possible solutions at the local level, they were involved in this decision-making model. Therefore, these specialized stakeholders did the weighting assignment according to the most or least importance of the same for the work. The map of priority locations to implement BGINs was obtained in the sequel. To the top 5 priority areas, stakeholders attributed the best solutions based on nature. The most recommended BGINs were recovery/maintenance of riparian vegetation and conservation and reforestation of the native forest, both presented in four of the five areas, and introduction of fuel management strips presented in three of the five areas. Thus, we concluded that it is extremely important to include the communities and the competent entities of nature and environment management in scientific projects related to conservation, forming a synergy that makes it possible to combine scientific knowledge with local experience acquired in the field. This project uses a very flexible methodology of local data and can be a great example to be implemented in other hydrographic basins anywhere in the world. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " \"Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have been gaining importance in many European cities to reduce floods' impacts. However, evidence of their effectiveness in reducing the impacts of droughts in rural areas are scarce. Besides, ignoring future climate conditions or the specific socio-economic context in which NBS is applied could decrease their long-term effectiveness. This study aims to stress the importance of developing scientifically-based and customised information on climate change impacts as a precondition for designing and implementing NBS. For that, a System Dynamic model was developed to analyse and understand the dynamic behaviour of NBS responding to different scenarios of climate change and socio-economic contexts. This article recognises the proactive involvement at all societal levels as an essential component to enhance and maintain ecosystem resilience and, therefore, NBS1 effectiveness. Thus, participatory modelling activities were carried out to engage stakeholders in the model development process to obtain relevant bottom-up information and organise stakeholders' collective knowledge in a graphical structure that captures the system's main dynamics. The Medina del Campo Groundwater Body was used as a frame for the analysis. The study results highlight the need for developing scientifically-based and customised information on the impacts of climate change on NBS as an essential precondition to maintain their long-term effectiveness. © 2021\",\n",
       " 'The idea of nature providing solutions to societal challenges is relatively easy to understand by the layperson. Nature-based solutions (NBS) against landslides and erosion mostly comprise plant-based interventions in which the reinforcement of slopes provided by vegetation plays a crucial role in natural hazard prevention and mitigation, and in the provision of multiple socio-ecological benefits. However, the full potential of NBS against landslides and erosion is not realised yet because a strong evidence base on their multi-functional performance is lacking, hindering the operational rigour of NBS practice and science. This knowledge gap can be addressed through the definition of repositories of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics, which should stem from holistic frameworks facilitating the multi-functional assessment of NBS. Herein, we propose the ‘rocket framework’ to promote the uptake of NBS against landslides and erosion through the provision of a comprehensive set of indicators which, through their appropriate selection and measurement, can contribute to build a robust evidence base on NBS performance. The ‘rocket framework’ is holistic, reproducible, dynamic, versatile, and flexible in helping define metrics for NBS actions against landslides and erosion along the NBS project timeline. The framework, resultant from an iterative research approach applied in a real-world environment, follows a hierarchical approach to deal with multiple scales and environmental contexts, and to integrate environmental, eco-engineering, and socio-ecological domains, thus establishing a balance between monitoring the engineering performance of NBS actions against landslides and erosion, and the wider provision of ecosystem functions and services. Using a case study, and following the principles of credibility, salience, legitimacy, and feasibility, we illustrate herein how the ‘rocket framework’ can be effectively employed to define a repository with over 40 performance indicators for monitoring NBS against landslides and erosion, and with over 60 metrics for establishing the context and baseline upon which the NBS are built and encourage their reproduction and upscaling. © Copyright © 2021 Gonzalez-Ollauri, Munro, Mickovski, Thomson and Emmanuel.',\n",
       " 'Mountain areas are highly exposed to flood risks. The latter are increasing in the context of climate change, urbanization, and land use changes. Non-structural approaches such as nature-based solutions can provide opportunities to reduce the risks of such natural hazards and provide further ecological, social, and economic benefits. However, few non-structural flood mitigation measures are implemented in rural mountain areas so far. The objective of this paper is to investigate if the scientific boundaries limit the implementation of non-structural flood management in rural mountain areas. In the study, we statistically analyzed the knowledge about flood management through a systematic literature review and expert surveys, with a focus on European rural mountain areas. Both methods showed that scientific knowledge is available for decision makers and that nature-based solutions are efficient, cost-effective, multifunctional, and have potential for large-scale implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) to climate change and other environmental challenges face a well-documented shortfall in financing and resource allocation. Economic evaluations of NBS that apply stated preference methods increasingly use time contributions instead of the traditionally used monetary contributions, especially in developing countries. These studies have focused on measuring the benefits of NBS and have not investigated the potential of freely provided community time contributions to reduce the financial needs of NBS. In this paper we investigate this potential through a systematic literature review and an analysis of four datasets from case studies in Ghana and Vietnam that apply similar questionnaires and discrete choice experiments with time contributions. We study a range of (de)motivating factors to contributing time to NBS and provide examples on the extent to which time contributions could reduce financial needs of NBS in developing countries. The results indicate that time contributions from households for the implementation and maintenance of NBS are motivated by social capital and coping appraisal. Time contribution schemes are therefore more likely to succeed in communities where social capital and coping appraisal are high and could be increased or maintained over time through the preservation and fostering of both these factors. The analysis also reveals that implementing time contributions would in general not lead to the exclusion of specific socio-demographic groups in society, such as lower income households. Finally, using two specific projects in Vietnam as examples, we calculate that time contributions can reduce 29% and 44% of the financial needs of NBS by covering the projects’ labour requirements. These results are of high importance to those working on NBS financing, awareness and behavior change campaigns, and practitioners that apply stated preference methods in developing countries. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'Adopting an interdisciplinary approach and framing sustainability issues from a resilience perspective, our paper first aimed to highlight nature-based solutions (NBSs) as levers to foster sustainable cities consistent with Agenda 2030-SDG 11 (2015) and the New Urban Agenda (Habitat III, 2016). Second, we empirically analyzed two Italian municipalities that are experimenting with initiatives of sustainable urban management and planning based on NBSs: The Municipality of Lucca in Tuscany and the Municipality of Latina in the Latium Region. These municipalities present institutional and socioeconomic similarities, making them an interesting study setting that allows us to draw significant lessons. We conducted four research steps: (1) theoretical background analysis, including resilience thinking in sustainable urban management. We investigated the role of NBSs in enabling urban resilience according to the last level of resilience, i.e., the transformative level. (2) We studied the contributions of NBSs to sustainable cities and resilience thinking. (3)We analyzed the NBSs’ projects of Lucca and Latina, and (4) we proposed an urban managerial tool: The NBSs’ curve, which facilitates the estimation of the NBS ecosystem endowment. The results of the NBS initiatives presented in this study have a two-fold value. First, they aim to combine citizens’ well-being with ecological and environmental aspects by better managing urban spaces that facilitate interpersonal relationships and resource sharing. Second, they are developed to meet the needs of local groups by serving as a stimulus (Fridays For Future movement) and as enablers (local associations) of managed actions. The lessons learned about the enhancement of sustainable cities through NBSs were thoroughly debated. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " \"Both the planning and public health literature have discussed proximity to greenspaces as predominantly beneficial to health, based on studies mostly conducted in high-income regions. Understanding the health risks of proximity to greenspace and nature—where pathogens and wildlife coexist—is important, as nature-based solutions are increasingly called for to address complex urban challenges. This exploratory pilot study bridges planning and epidemiology approaches to develop a new method to analyze habitat and environmental factors associated with the risk of vector-borne Chagas disease in a low-income region, South Texas. Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America, where it affects between seven to eight million people and where environmental factors have been studied to limit the disease's spread. The disease is considered endemic in the southern United States, where little is known about environmental risks. In this pilot study, we developed a new methodology to analyze publicly available habitat and environmental secondary data, which could be used by planning departments. We applied the method to a prior pilot study, which determined a 19.6% prevalence level of T. cruzi (the agent of Chagas disease) among 209 domestic dogs. We geocoded the sample to 100 low-income residential locations, which yielded a 32% positivity rate, and collected secondary data surrounding each location. Logistical regression of factors yielded the following risks: adjacent unconstructed lots, and the presence of four or more dogs in a yard. Based on the results, we formulated vector control-based planning policy recommendations to prevent the spread of the disease. © 2021\",\n",
       " 'Mangroves are one the most productive ecosystems on Earth, and they are geographically located in the tropics and sub-tropics. Notwithstanding their critical role in providing a large number of environmental services and benefits as well as livelihood provisions, mangrove forests are being lost globally at an alarming rate. At the same time, they are increasingly recognized as a cost-effective nature-based climate solution for their carbon sequestration and storage capacity. Despite their enormous importance to people’s lives and the ecosystem, no bibliometric study on this topic has been published to our knowledge. Here, we provide a bibliometric analysis of the research on mangroves with research trends, most influential research based on citation count, and the origins (country and institution) of major research. Using the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) database of the Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), we identified 13,918 documents published between 1990 and 2019. Nevertheless, 12,955 articles met our final criteria and were analyzed in detail. Six publications and their citations per publication (CPP2019 ) were applied to evaluate the publication performance of countries and institutes. When considering the top ten Web of Science subject categories, articles published on the ecology of mangroves had the highest CPP2019 of 28. Environmental sciences have been the major category since 2013. The USA dominated the total articles and single-author articles. The USA was also the most frequent partner of international collaborative publications. China published the most single-country articles, first-author articles, and corresponding-author articles. However, articles by the USA and Australia had a higher CPP2019 . Sun Yat Sen University in China was the most active university. The Australian Institute of Marine Science dominated all kinds of publications with the top CPP2019 . Together with the USA, Australia, China, India, Brazil, and Japan ranked both the top six on total publications and total publications in 2019.

       " 'Nature-based enterprises (NBEs) have recently emerged as important actors in the delivery of nature-based solutions (NBS) to societal challenges, but little is known about the context in which they operate and the factors influencing their development. The empirical research undertaken in this study provides a first insight into the most significant barriers and enablers nature-based enterprises face in their external environment. Findings were drawn from a review of literature triangulated with a survey of 148 nature-based enterprises and interviews with the founders/CEOs of 22 NBEs. Political factors were identified as the most significant external influence, with increased awareness and incorporation of NBS into relevant policies and economic instruments seen to play a significant role in market development. Conversely, policy inconsistencies and poorly designed public procurement approaches present significant challenges. Other key influencing factors relate to financing (both public and private), lack of industry standards and impact measurement. Industry networking and access to education, training and skill development emerged as key enablers, with university collaborations highly regarded. Further in-depth research is recommended to explore indications of disparities in the levels of awareness, financing, and skills gaps across different regions of Europe and different nature-based economic activities. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Land-based climate mitigation measures have gained significant attention and importance in public and private sector climate policies. Building on previous studies, we refine and update the mitigation potentials for 20\\xa0land-based measures in &gt;200 countries and five regions, comparing “bottom-up” sectoral estimates with integrated assessment models (IAMs). We also assess implementation feasibility at the country level. Cost-effective (available up to $100/tCO2eq) land-based mitigation is 8–13.8 GtCO2eq yr−1 between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the IAM median and the upper end representing the sectoral estimate. The cost-effective sectoral estimate is about 40% of available technical potential and is in line with achieving a 1.5°C pathway in 2050. Compared to technical potentials, cost-effective estimates represent a more realistic and actionable target for policy. The cost-effective potential is approximately 50% from forests and other ecosystems, 35% from agriculture, and 15% from demand-side measures. The potential varies sixfold across the five regions assessed (0.75–4.8 GtCO2eq yr−1) and the top 15 countries account for about 60% of the global potential. Protection of forests and other ecosystems and demand-side measures present particularly high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs. The feasibility assessment suggests that governance, economic investment, and socio-cultural conditions influence the likelihood that land-based mitigation potentials are realized. A substantial portion of potential (80%) is in developing countries and LDCs, where feasibility barriers are of greatest concern. Assisting countries to overcome barriers may result in significant quantities of near-term, low-cost mitigation while locally achieving important climate adaptation and development benefits. Opportunities among countries vary widely depending on types of land-based measures available, their potential co-benefits and risks, and their feasibility. Enhanced investments and country-specific plans that accommodate this complexity are urgently needed to realize the large global potential from improved land stewardship. © 2021 The Authors.

       " 'Greywater (GW) can be separated in different fractions where the kitchen component might be included. Constructed wetland (CW) systems are commonly used for the onsite treatment of GW, and the fraction treated might impact the performance, operation, and maintenance. These aspects are still poorly explored in the literature and are of importance for a proper design and system sustainability. In this study, a multi-stage household-scale CW system composed of a horizontal flow (HF), followed by a vertical flow (VF) unit, was monitored over 1330 days, focusing on different GW fractions and hydraulic and organic loading rates. The biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) was ~50% lower without the kitchen sink component (GWL ) in the system inlet, while no drop was observed in the chemical oxygen demand (COD). Treatment with the GWL component caused a sudden drop in the hydraulic loading rate applied at the HF-CW (~114 to 35 mm per day) and the VF-CW (~230 to 70 mm per day). Even when the HF-CW received ~90 gCOD m−2 per day (GW), the multistage system reached a COD removal of 90%. The lower BOD load when treating GWL avoids clogging and decreases the frequency of maintenance. These variables can be used for the optimal design and operation of a CW, contributing with empirical data to CW guidelines in Brazil, and could additionally be expanded for application in other countries with similar climates. © 2021 by the authors.

In these unique plantings, a variety of nut-and fruit-producing trees and berry shrubs are often established together on public spaces to provide the community with healthy, fresh food. Interest in these plantings has been increasing in the United States, even more so since the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in our food systems. However, the roots of community orchards can be traced back to Indigenous foodways which have persisted for millennia. Then and now, community orchards support an array of functions, positioning them to contribute to solutions to major challenges related to food security, human health, and climate resilience. In this paper, contemporary applications are considered for Indigenous communities in the US that seek to care for their communities and the environment. A case study of the Osage Orchard project in Pawhuska, OK, USA, highlights the value of reconnecting with cultural foods and practices of Osage ancestors, to meet the needs and preferences of a contemporary Indigenous community. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'One of the essential factors influencing the overall urban experience is the presence of biologically active surfaces. Despite widespread awareness of the beneficial effects of such spaces, the natural tissue in cities is still being significantly limited by the priority given to functionality and the economy. The aim of this article is to assess the potential of using a hybrid infrastructure in the grey–green–blue system (GGB) on a public site. In order to assess the efficiency of the implemented solutions, a multi-criteria method was developed, thereby recognising this research aspect as necessary in the process of designing urban built-up spaces. The assessment compared indicators of biological activity in the area using the biotope area factor and green space factor scales. The rainwater retention potential was estimated using a quantitative method. The change in the site’s thermal conditions was analysed by conducting numerous experiments with the use of micrometeorogical computational fluid dynamics models ENVI-met. The demonstrated improvement in the proportion of the biologically active area, water retention, and thermal conditions, ranging from a few to a dozen percent compared to the initial state, confirms the legitimacy of using grey– green–blue infrastructure systems as a method of shaping a sustainable and climate-responsive urban design. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Industrial and technological development have contributed significantly to causing environmental crises, such as climate change and land degradation. To address these environmental challenges, nature-based solutions (NBS) have gained increased attention over conventional technical responses. This study derived conceptual linkages from NBS application to resilience promotion, and subsequently, to the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The study was conducted to reveal that NBS activities are an essential approach that determines the balance between human development and nature conservation. In this paper, we compare four case studies, one domestic reforestation project and three international afforestation projects, all of which had forest-related NBS experiences and were conducted by the Republic of Korea. All four projects were found to have an impact on environmental and socio-economic resilience. These impacts were qualitatively assessed through resilience indicator evaluations. Subsequently, the resilience indicators were matched with the targets of the SDGs. NBS initiatives designed to include various natural and social elements promoted the resilience of ecosystems and society and address a broader spectrum of SDGs. Further efforts to establish region-specific promotional models, identify resilience indicators, and collect scientific data are recommended for quantitatively assessing the NBS initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Practices and research on measuring traditionally urban sustainability abound, therefore the challenge now is related to how the urban carbon issues are included into current measuring methods, thus there is a need to develop methods for measuring urban low-carbon sustainability. In this paper, a simple method, which is based on low-carbon sustainability index, is developed. The overall urban low-carbon sustainability index is the weighted sum of 11 single indices, and each single index is defined as the indicator assessing the development level against the baseline. The baseline is often the criteria or the minimum requirement of low-carbon sustainability. Case studies in four Chinese cities have put this method into practice, and the results show that all four selected cities fail to pass the testing of sensible low-carbon sustainability rule and they are all in weakly low-carbon sustainable development. Although the four cities have made great progress in their capacity building on pollution control and their capacities on wastewater treatment, main pollutants’ removal and household and hazardous wastes treatment are enough to meet the needs of local development, they are all facing the great challenges on using of sustainable energy, offsetting of CO2 emissions and adoptions of nature-based solutions. The method developed by this research is a useful tool for decision makers identifying whether the local development is not on a low-carbon sustainable path. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Internationally, shifts to more urbanised populations, and resultant reductions in engagements with nature, have been a contributing factor to the mental health crisis facing many developed and developing countries. While the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced recent trends in many countries to give access to green spaces more weight in political decision making, nature-based activities as a form of intervention for those with mental health problems constitute a very small part of patient pathways of care. Nature-based interventions, such as ecotherapy, are increasingly used as therapeutic solutions for people with common mental health problems. However, there is little data about the potential costs and benefits of ecotherapy, making it difficult to offer robust assessments of its cost-effectiveness. This paper explores the capacity for ecotherapy to be cost-effective as a healthcare intervention. Using a pragmatic scoping review of the literature to understand where the potential costs and health benefit lie, we applied value of information methodology to identify what research is needed to inform future cost-effectiveness assessments. We show that there is the potential for ecotherapy for people with mild to moderate common mental health problems to be cost-effective but significant further research is required. Furthermore, nature-based interventions such as ecotherapy also confer potential social and wider returns on investment, strengthening the case for further research to better inform robust commissioning. © 2021 by the authors.

       " \"The dynamics and processes of nutrient cycling and release were examined for a lowland wetland-pond system, draining woodland in southern England. Hydrochemical and meteorological data were analyzed from 1997 to 2017, along with high-resolution in situ sensor measurements from 2016 to 2017. The results showed that even a relatively pristine wetland can become a source of highly bioavailable phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and silicon (Si) during low-flow periods of high ecological sensitivity. The drivers of nutrient release were primary production and accumulation of biomass, which provided a carbon (C) source for microbial respiration and, via mineralization, a source of bioavailable nutrients for P and N co-limited microorganisms. During high-intensity nutrient release events, the dominant N-cycling process switched from denitrification to nitrate ammonification, and a positive feedback cycle of P and N release was sustained over several months during summer and fall. Temperature controls on microbial activity were the primary drivers of short-term (day-to-day) variability in P release, with subdaily (diurnal) fluctuations in P concentrations driven by water body metabolism. Interannual relationships between nutrient release and climate variables indicated “memory” effects of antecedent climate drivers through accumulated legacy organic matter from the previous year's biomass production. Natural flood management initiatives promote the use of wetlands as “nature-based solutions” in climate change adaptation, flood management, and soil and water conservation. This study highlights potential water quality trade-offs and shows how the convergence of climate and biogeochemical drivers of wetland nutrient release can amplify background nutrient signals by mobilizing legacy nutrients, causing water quality impairment and accelerating eutrophication risk. © 2020 The Authors.

       " 'Due to the clime change scenario, severe hydro‐meteorological phenomena are having a high impact on the ecosystems of the earth. Some strategies based on the use of natural communities associated with geomorphological changes that restore the natural landscape are gaining success due the resistance and resilience against damages. All of these strategies are known as nature‐based solutions (NBS). Soil and water bioengineering techniques are one of the most appreciated tools to reach effectiveness for slope stabilization. They are based on the capacity of some plants to consolidate the soil with his rooting system in special conditions (high slope, flooding impact). Slope stabilization solutions with soil and water bioengineering techniques need to be adapted to this new scenario. Crib wall is one of the most complete soil and water bioengineering technique for structural slope stabilization. It is based on a wooden box full of live plants that in the future will grow and gain stability at the same time that wood decays. The crib wall box is full of soil, and the front area is traditionally stabilized with some branches of fascines to let plants grow, maintaining the structure. Fascines are made of branches of riparian species with the capacity for vegetative propagation. Their diameter can change due to the humidity variation, so the stiffness of the system is at risk against severe hydro‐meteorological phenomena. This study aims to assess that the introduction of HDCL in crib walls improves planting success and makes them more resistant to adverse weather events in Mediterranean areas. Four experiments were performed in controlled and natural conditions with this proposal. The results show that the use of natural fibers instead of branch fascine helps to maintain the humidity conditions and increase the resistance capacity. Highdensity coir logs (HDCL) are not affected by volume changes for humidity conditions. HDCL maintains the plant’s humidity conditions longer and makes plants grow faster, bigger and increase their survival. This method of Crib wall construction increases the associated biodiversity. The most important results are that the use of HDCL in crib walls has an effect on the growth of planted shrub, the development of roots, the colonization of native vegetation and ultimately, the resistance of the structure to the floods. The results also show that crib walls are a good technique for the stabilization of slopes with considerable gradients and high hydraulic impacts. HDCL can reduce the water stress of plantations, and they can be a good system to retain runoff and provide it to the plants. Finally, the HDCL allows the revegetation of a crib wall 30% faster than with branch fascine. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Governance, financing, and business models are deeply interlinked and relevant for the successful implementation of urban nature-based solutions (NBS). However, during the definition of urban NBS projects the importance and interrelation of these models are usually neglected. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents an overarching framework (conceptual and operational) and a derived preselection web tool which interrelate governance, financing, and business models for NBS projects. First, based on recent literature, governance, financing, and business models that could be applied to NBS were mapped, and their integration proposed. Later, key contextual factors influencing NBS implementation were identified. They form the basis of a WHAT– WHO–HOW framework that structures the links between specific NBS projects, their implementation context, and the most suitable models. From that framework, and an analysis of 50 successful NBS case studies, a suitability matrix was developed with known models. The matrix allows pairing types of NBS and their initiating actors with suitable financing and governance models. Lastly, a tailored NBS business model canvas was designed to evaluate the business model components. From the overarching framework, the preselection web tool was created to guide decision-making on suitable governance, finance, and business models in the early phases of NBS projects. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The UN declaration of the Decade of Ecosystem Restoration 2021–2030 emphasizes the need for effective measures to restore ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity. Large herbivores regulate many ecosystem processes and functions; yet, their potential as a nature-based solution to buffer against long-term temporal declines in biodiversity associated with global change and restore diversity in secondary forests remains unknown. By means of an exclusion experiment, we tested experimentally the buffering effects of large wild herbivores to avert against long-term biodiversity collapse in old-growth and secondary tropical forests in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil where sapling abundance and species richness declined c. 20% over the course of 10\\xa0years. The experiment comprised 50 large herbivore exclosure-open control plot pairs (25 at the old-growth forest and 25 at the secondary forest), where 2\\xa0m2 were monitored in every plot during a 10-year period. Large herbivores were able to decelerate diversity declines and compositional change in the species-rich old-growth forest, but only decelerated compositional change in the secondary forest. In contrast, declines in species richness and abundance were unaffected by large herbivores on either forest. The buffering effects of large herbivores were strongly nonlinear and contingent on the initial level of diversity at the patch scale: highly diverse communities suffered the strongest collapse in the absence of large herbivores. Thus, larger buffering effects of large herbivores on the old-growth forest are the logical consequence of large herbivores buffering the many high diversity plant communities found in this forest. Conversely, as the secondary forest held fewer high diversity patches, buffering effects on the secondary forest were weak. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that large herbivores have moderate yet critical effects on slowing down community change and diversity loss of highly diverse plant communities, thus suggesting that the conservation of (and potentially trophic rewilding with) large herbivores is a fundamental nature-based solution for averting the global collapse of the strongholds of biodiversity. Its buffering effects on biodiversity loss operate at very small spatial scales, are likely contingent on successional stage and are most effective in old-growth or high diversity secondary forests. © 2021 IPE - Instituto de Pesquisas Ecologicas.

       " 'The urban heat island (UHI) effect is among the most critical issues caused by human activities and high building density. UHI has severe impacts on the urban and natural environment as well as on human health and wellbeing. The research presented here aims at evaluating the effects of nature-based solutions (NBS) in improving the livability of a district in the city of Genoa, which is heavily cemented and a major example of the heat island phenomenon. This study focuses on the microclimatic benefits of urban heat island mitigation as well as on psychological and perceptual aspects. A preliminary analysis of the district through CFD simulations using Envi-met software allowed for selection of the most suitable areas for a system of punctual interventions in urban regeneration using nature-based solutions. For each area identified, we simulated the effects of different design scenarios on microclimate mitigation and thermal comfort improvement. In addition, to evaluate the perceptual benefits of the most well-performing design scenarios, we set up a web-based survey that was administered to a convenience sample of Genoa residents. In terms of aesthetic satisfaction and perception of improved conditions of physical and psychological well-being, the preferred design outcomes were those which emphasized a freer and more natural environment. This study shows that nature-based solutions can improve the overall conditions of dense urban areas; microclimate performance and psychological effects should be both considered in the design process in order to improve the wellbeing of urban citizens. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) positively impact ecological landscape quality (ELQ) by providing multiple benefits, including enhancing natural capital, promoting biodiversity, mitigating water runoff, increasing water retention, and contributing to climate change adaptations and carbon sequestration. To analyze the specific contribution of different NBS types, this study assessed 14 ELQ indicators based on the application of spatial data. Five NBS based on existing elements of green and blue infrastructure (GBI) were analyzed at the city level (Lublin, Poland), including parks (UPs), forests (UFs), water bodies (UWs), allotment gardens (AGs), and woods (Ws). The analysis revealed that different NBS contribute in contrasting ways to the improvement of various dimensions of ELQ. UFs made the biggest contribution to the maintenance of ecological processes and stability, as well as to aesthetic values. Ws together with AGs were crucial to maintaining a high level of diversity at the landscape scale and also contributed to preserving the ecological structure. UWs and UPs had no outstanding impact on ELQ, mainly due to their high level of anthropogenic transformation. The application of spatial indicators proved useful in providing approximate information on the ecological values of different types of NBS when other data types were either unavailable or were only available at a high cost and with considerable time and effort. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The global climate crisis precipitates a call to ‘futureproof’ cities by introducing resilient climate-adapted urban green infrastructure (UGI). Recent UK research has revealed public support for climate-adapted UGI, yet there is a lack of research focusing on the values underlying public perceptions, particularly in relation to climate change, and the socio-cultural factors driving these. This was addressed by asking 249 people to walk through one of three contrasting areas of planting: exotic (climate-adapted); traditional or cottage-garden, within a designed garden setting, whilst conducting a self-guided questionnaire assessing participants’ perceptions of aesthetics, self-reported restorative effect, and plant and invertebrate biodiversity. Participants’ held values in relation to climate change, non-native species, and nature-connectedness were also addressed. Findings indicated aesthetic preference for climate-adapted planting over the other two styles, providing further evidence of cultural acceptance for policymakers and land-managers seeking to ‘futureproof’ cities by introducing climate-adapted UGI. Planting of a cottage-garden style was perceived as the least attractive, but the most restorative. Socio-cultural characteristics including age, educational qualifications, and taking holidays overseas were drivers of perceptions. Professional involvement and interest in the environment, landscape, and horticulture were identified as drivers of perceptions and values. Values in relation to climate change were directly related to participants’ educational qualifications. This identifies a need to consider novel approaches to climate change education to promote wider understanding of the implications of climate-change and the potential for climate-adapted UGI to deliver ‘futureproofing’ benefits for climate-change mitigation and human mental wellbeing. © 2021 The Author',\n",
       " 'The recognition of the features and capabilities of potentially toxic elements (PTE) uptake from urban tree leaves is crucial for mitigating pollution and optimizing the allocation of green infrastructures of an urban environment. Therefore, Pb, Ni, Mo, Cu, Zn contents and spatiotemporal variation were investigated in the leaves of the most widespread urban trees in Yerevan (Armenia) (Fraxinus excelsior L. and Platanus orientalis L.) by means of a chemical approach based on atomic-absorption spectroscopy, after having washed them. The obtained results showed similarities in leaves Ni, Cu, Pb and Mo uptake. Meanwhile, only biologically non-essential elements (Mo and Pb) tend to accumulate in leaves during the vegetation season. This allows for the identification of localized pollution sources. Spatiotemporal variation of Zn contents suggested that P. orientalis L. is the less efficient tree species in Zn uptake. The study of the relationship of Pb, Ni, Mo, Cu, and land use by means of clr-biplots showed the absence of any potential links. Moreover, it was revealed that the element contents of leaves in green areas are similar to those observed in industrial and residential sites. The latter highlighted the need for the expansion of green areas with the use of scientifically justified species as a means of nature-based solution for pollution mitigation and better urban environmental management. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'The implementation of nature-based solutions (NbS) largely depends on the strategic planning of urban green infrastructure (UGI) and the measures adopted for planning and maintaining urban green areas under investment pressure. UGI planning is highly important for housing areas, and its elements are often used in selling campaigns for developers’ investments. In many cases, when developers refer to ecological values and greenery \\u200b\\u200bin promotional campaigns, these are often considered as greenwashing (GW). The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency and mechanism of providing greenery and ecological solutions in renderings, the types of vegetation presented, and the approach of the developers to the existing greenery and other ecological values. The authors selected and analysed 73 development offers from 25 developers in Poznań, which is a major city in Poland with intensive development of housing investments. All the investments were analysed for the contents of advertisements and illustrations (plans and renderings). In the first stage of the study, analyses were conducted according to three groups of criteria: 1) creating an image of a green estate, 2) types of green spaces, and 3) approach to the existing green resources. The results revealed the importance of greenery in developers’ strategies. In the second stage, another four criteria for NbS and four indicators of GW were identified. The analysis helped us in assessing whether the offers met the NbS or GW assumptions. Statistical analyses showed that offers with the largest amount of GW indicators, indicating near and accessible green spaces, were primarily located distantly. The study verified that most of the marketing strategies of selected developers in Poznań should be considered as GW, and only a few estates exhibited NbS characteristics. However, the indicators of GW are often observed in the same cases. Further, the question arises whether NbS would be implemented in housing estates, in the absence of systemic regulations mandating the use of environmentally friendly solutions. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'There is an increasing recognition that, although the climate change and biodiversity crises are fundamentally connected, they have been primarily addressed independently and a more integrated global approach is essential to tackle these two global challenges. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are hailed as a pathway for promoting synergies between the climate change and biodiversity agendas. There are, however, uncertainties and difficulties associated with the implementation of NbS, while the evidence regarding their benefits for biodiversity remains limited. We identify five key research areas where incomplete or poor information hinders the development of integrated biodiversity and climate solutions. These relate to refining our understanding of how climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches benefit biodiversity conservation; enhancing our ability to track and predict ecosystems on the move and/or facing collapse; improving our capacity to predict the impacts of climate change on the effectiveness of NbS; developing solutions that match the temporal, spatial and functional scale of the challenges; and developing a comprehensive and practical framework for assessing, and mitigating against, the risks posed by the implementation of NbS. Policy implications. The Conference of the Parties (COP) for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) present a clear policy window for developing coherent policy frameworks that align targets across the nexus of biodiversity and climate change. This window should (a) address the substantial and chronic underfunding of global biodiversity conservation, (b) remove financial incentives that negatively impact biodiversity and/or climate change, (c) develop higher levels of integration between the biodiversity and climate change agendas, (d) agree on a monitoring framework that enables the standardised quantification and comparison of biodiversity gains associated with NbS across ecosystems and over time and (e) rethink environmental legislation to better support biodiversity conservation in times of rapid climatic change. © 2021 The Authors.

       " \"Increasing focus on Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in cities has significantly expanded the range of applications in which urban nature is considered useful, as well as the range of NBS available. Traditional parks, gardens and street trees now sit alongside innovative approaches including rooftop pollinator habitats, constructed wetlands and hydroponic green facades, each of which has its own particular challenges and benefits. This variety of solutions introduces an important new decision-making challenge for cities wishing to implement NBS: choosing the right set of specific NBS interventions. Decision support tools such as Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can help navigate complex decisions, but their application to urban NBS selection decisions has been limited. Current NBS assessment frameworks tend to either give highly aggregated results, or are tailored to only one specific ecosystem service. Here we demonstrate a novel application of MCDA to the practical challenge of selecting a set of NBS to address multiple urban challenges. The MCDA tool developed here was used in seven cities participating in the European Union project ‘Urban GreenUP’. We describe the development and use of the MCDA tool, and explore how cities used the tool to guide NBS selection. We also evaluate the tool using sensitivity analysis and feedback from users. We find that participating cities are seeking to balance a large number of possible benefits from NBS solutions, and the tool proved useful for navigating the selection decision. Users identified opportunities to improve the tool's usability and clarity. They also noted a key strength of the tool as a prompt for co-production of knowledge and decisions. Collectively, these findings advance the design and application of tools to support complex decisions about selecting NBS to address diverse urban challenges. © 2021 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Many cities are increasing urban canopy cover to mitigate the impacts of urbanisation and climate change. Ambitious canopy cover targets are being implemented, with little consideration on how best to achieve them. The City of Bristol has recently published a One City Plan, which includes a target to double tree canopy cover by 2045. This study aims to investigate its feasibility, and explore different planting scenarios to achieve the target and maximise ecosystem service delivery. Using an existing i-Tree Eco assessment of the urban forest, i-Tree Forecast was used to project future urban forest growth under a number of different user-defined planting scenarios. Sixteen scenarios were forecasted over 27 years to test a variety of approaches. Tree stock size and number, timing of planting and annual mortality rates were varied to test the performance of each scenario. Planting 18,000 large tree stock, equivalent to ‘heavy standards’ every year for 27 years provided the most feasible scenario in balancing canopy cover, leaf area index and pollutant removal whilst providing a stable population. This increased to 44,000 trees per year assuming an annual mortality rate of 3 % more typical of urban areas, demonstrating the importance of good stewardship. The size of planted tree and timing of planting had a strong impact on the development of canopy cover. It was concluded that the One City Plan target is feasible if the planting rate is increased to at least 18,000 large tree stock from the current 10,000 trees per year. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " \"Marine spatial planning that addresses ocean climate-driven change (‘climate-smart MSP’) is a global aspiration to support economic growth, food security and ecosystem sustainability. Ocean climate change (‘CC’) modelling may become a key decision-support tool for MSP, but traditional modelling analysis and communication challenges prevent their broad uptake. We employed MSP-specific ocean climate modelling analyses to inform a real-life MSP process; addressing how nature conservation and fisheries could be adapted to CC. We found that the currently planned distribution of these activities may become unsustainable during the policy's implementation due to CC, leading to a shortfall in its sustainability and blue growth targets. Significant, climate-driven ecosystem-level shifts in ocean components underpinning designated sites and fishing activity were estimated, reflecting different magnitudes of shifts in benthic versus pelagic, and inshore versus offshore habitats. Supporting adaptation, we then identified: CC refugia (areas where the ecosystem remains within the boundaries of its present state); CC hotspots (where climate drives the ecosystem towards a new state, inconsistent with each sectors’ present use distribution); and for the first time, identified bright spots (areas where oceanographic processes drive range expansion opportunities that may support sustainable growth in the medium term). We thus create the means to: identify where sector-relevant ecosystem change is attributable to CC; incorporate resilient delivery of conservation and sustainable ecosystem management aims into MSP; and to harness opportunities for blue growth where they exist. Capturing CC bright spots alongside refugia within protected areas may present important opportunities to meet sustainability targets while helping support the fishing sector in a changing climate. By capitalizing on the natural distribution of climate resilience within ocean ecosystems, such climate-adaptive spatial management strategies could be seen as nature-based solutions to limit the impact of CC on ocean ecosystems and dependent blue economy sectors, paving the way for climate-smart MSP. © 2021 The Authors.

       " \"Many national governments have incorporated nature-based solutions (NbS) in their plans to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. However, uncertainties persist regarding both feasibility and consequences of major NbS deployment. Using the United Kingdom as a national-level case study, we examined the potential contribution of three terrestrial NbS: peatland restoration, saltmarsh creation and woodland creation. While there is substantial political and societal interest in these three NbS, they also have strong potential for competition with other land uses, which will be a critical barrier to substantial deployment. We conducted a national mapping exercise to assess the potential area available for woodland creation. We then assessed the combined climate change mitigation potential to 2100 for the three NbS options under a range of ambition levels. In line with the most ambitious targets examined, 2\\xa0Mha of land is potentially available for new woodland. However, climate change mitigation benefits of woodland are strongly dependent on management choices. By 2100, scenarios with a greater proportion of broadleaved woodlands outsequester non-native conifer plantations, which are limited by regular timber harvesting. Peatland restoration offers the greatest mitigation per unit area, whilst the contribution from saltmarsh creation is limited by the small areas involved. Overall, the contribution of these NbS to the United Kingdom’s net zero emissions target is relatively modest. Even with the most ambitious targets considered here, by 2100, the total cumulative mitigation from the three NbS is equivalent to only 3\\xa0years' worth of UK emissions at current levels. Policy implications. Major deployment of nature-based solutions (NbS) is possible in the United Kingdom but reaching ‘net zero’ primarily requires substantial and sustained reductions in fossil fuel use. However, facilitating these NbS at the national scale could offer many additional benefits for people and biodiversity. This demands that policy-makers commit to a UK-wide strategic approach that prioritises the ‘nature’ aspect of NbS. In the push to reach ‘net zero’, climate change mitigation should not be used to justify land management practices that threaten biodiversity ambitions. © 2021 The Authors.

       " \"Climate change is an urgent challenge in urban planning. Weather extremes and resulting impacts such as heat waves and flash floods are already influencing the quality of life in cities and impact on infrastructure, human health and city life. In this study, we investigated perception of and economic preferences for adaptation to climate change in one of Europe's capital cities to inform its planning policy. Through a choice experiment, we elicit the preferences of a sample (n = 550) from Prague, Czech Republic, for a citywide policy which would increase the use of six commonly used nature-based solutions (NBS) in public spaces and on public buildings across the city. Three attributes were used to describe this policy: (i) the locations where NBS would predominantly be implemented, (ii) the species diversity of these measures, and (iii) their implied costs for households. Our results showed that the NBS policy is widely supported by the public over the status quo and that this preference is mirrored in citizens’ concerns about climate change and the risks posed by heatwaves particularly. Species diversity matters in the portrayed scenarios, suggesting that (bio)diverse NBS generate additional public value over single species measures and that policy which targets biodiversity may gain support. Implementation of NBS in public spaces (e.g., street trees, rain gardens) is preferred over measures implemented on public buildings (green roofs and facades). Furthermore, adverse experiences with heatwaves has increased support for the policy. The presented results provide evidence that adaptation planning through NBS is likely to generate significant public value which is expected to increase with the intensifying effects of climate change. © 2021\",\n",
       " 'Many European countries witness growing interest in allotment gardening. Thus, private allotment gardens (AGs) have been created in some countries, including Spain. As a result, there are places where non-consumptive and commodified allotment gardens coexist. The paper presents an in-depth comparison of public and private AGs through the lens of the nature-based solutions (NBS) concept. First, we assess the importance that gardeners attribute to the spectrum of environmental and socio-economic impacts provided by both types of AGs; we identify differences and similarities in their development and management, and assess the demographic and socioeconomic profile of gardeners. Subsequently, we discuss gardeners’ and other stakeholders’ opinions on both types of AGs and explore the roles that they can play as solutions for urban policy challenges. Our results show that both types of AGs are nature-based solutions with particularly positive impacts on the health and well-being of their users. These gardens do not compete but complement each other, fostered by their role as multifunctional nature-based solutions. Moreover, the option of cultivating a private or a public AG seems to be more linked to the freedom of cultivation and the freedom of access rather than economic reasons. We conclude that in the current complex scenario, public and private AGs must have territorial, legal and institutional frameworks within all urban policies that explore NBS. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'Although a large number of river restoration projects have been implemented around the world, quantitative outcomes of the projects are often not well documented. The main purpose of this study is to assess changes in water quality of two completed river restoration projects, which convert heavily channelized streams into more natural conditions using nature-based solutions. Another purpose is to examine factors behind changes in water quality, based on which to identify possible ways to improve the design and operation management of similar projects in the future. An upstream-downstream sampling approach was used, making it possible to directly compare changes in water quality before and after the restored sites by reducing variations due to seasonality, land use, and other uncontrollable external factors. A number of water quality parameters were tested, and statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of the restored sites and the correlations of water quality parameters. General improvements in water quality were found at one of the restoration sites, but not at the other. It was found that not only water quality but also the effects of restoration on water quality is subject to seasonal variations. Correlations between certain water quality parameters point to some common sources of pollution in the urban context. Possible causes behind the performance difference of the two sites are discussed, and improvements on design and operation management practices are recommended. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

To overcome this, we develop a theoretical framework based on deliberation, local ecological knowledge, and quantified values that we operationalize by adapting a conventional Q-method (a mixed-methods research approach) into a deliberative process by combining it with the qualitative focus group method. We empirically test this method in Amman, Jordan by analyzing how local experts, based on their local ecological knowledge, value urban water features amid severe water scarcity. By weighing the local experts' competing values to better understand polarized and consensus views, our results reveal two juxtaposing opinions regarding the conception of Amman's urban surface waters. Decision makers can use these findings to set management priorities and/or make landscape/policy interventions that reduce the likelihood of stakeholder conflict. We also recommend that the Greater Amman Municipality should integrate nature-based solutions (e.g., stream daylighting) in future decision making to capitalize on urban ecosystem services, while maintaining a high degree of human health and safety (e.g., from climatic hazards).

       " \"In low-income regions and small/medium communities, the use of conventional/mechanical methods for wastewater treatment is not always financially and technically feasible. Thus, nature-based solutions such as constructed wetlands (CW) appear as a more appropriate option. Additionally, there is limited application and reporting on the use and efficiency of this sustainable technology in arid and warm climates such as in the Middle East. In order to get a better insight into the feasibility of CWs under such climate and socio-economic context, a full-scale demonstration hybrid CW facility was built and monitored for the first time at a university campus in Iran for one year. The facility consists of an anaerobic baffled reactor, a vertical flow CW and a polishing horizontal subsurface flow CW and has a total area demand of 2.5 m2/pe. The goal was to evaluate the system's efficiency and investigate the need for one or two CW stages to reach the national effluent reuse standard. The CW were planted with local species (Arundo donax, Cortaderia selloana, Phragmites australis) and received 20 m3/day from a university dormitory at a hydraulic loading rate of 5 cm/day.

This capability is being threatened by the continued occurrence of large-scale wildfires across the western United States. The wildfires damage watersheds in part by denuding landscapes, reducing infiltration rates, and increasing runoff rates, thereby dramatically increasing the potential for the erosion of denuded slopes, destabilizing stream channels, increasing the infilling potential of reservoirs and, hence, reducing their capacity. The increased erosion rates highlight the need to develop innovative solutions to reduce erosion of watersheds laid bare after wildfires engulf the area. The Santa Clara Pueblo in northern New Mexico extends from the top of the eastern Jemez Mountains to the floodplains of the Rio Grande River. The Pueblo designed and constructed thousands of structures built from natural materials, consistent with Engineering With Nature (EWN) principles for erosion control incorporating low-cost and readily available materials such as logs, mulch, vegetation, and local rock to stabilize highly erodible parts of the watershed. The watersheds where these natural structures were constructed were monitored after construction to assess their effectiveness, guiding a series of recommendations for broader implementation. As part of a continued emphasis on updating USACE engineering guidance, research, and development, funding has been focused on developing sustainable and resilient project designs using natural materials like those implemented by the Santa Clara Pueblo.

This raises concerns about a potential increase of stormwater toxicity and reduced performance of the treatment infrastructures. To tackle these issues, we developed a simple, low-cost bioretention system to remediate stormwater and retain ZnO-NPs. This system retained up to 73% Zn, 66% Cu, and >99% Pb. However, the removal efficiency for Pb was lower after adding ZnO-NPs to the system, possibly due to the remobilization of Pb phosphates. The effect of ZnO-NPs on stormwater toxicity and metal accumulation in wetland plants was also evaluated. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Managing coastal ecosystems and preserving socio-ecological functioning require a comprehensive understanding of ecological services provided by resident organisms. Here, we provide novel information on water-filtration activities of endobenthic sandprawns (Callichirus kraussi), which are key ecosystem engineers in South African coasts. We demonstrate experimentally that benthic engineering by sandprawns reduces phytoplankton biomass by roughly 50%. Using long-term estuarine data, we demonstrate similar reductions in phytoplankton biomass (by roughly 70%) in sandprawn-dominated areas. Increased burrow wall chlorophyll-a relative to surface sediments that was evident in experiments suggests that pelagic filtration occurs through bi-directional water pumping and phytoplankton adsorption onto burrow walls. Our findings expand understanding of the ecological relevance of sandprawns and functionally similar organisms, the mechanisms by which they engineer ecosystems and their role in mediating coastal bentho-pelagic coupling. Our findings also highlight the potential for deposit-feeders to be used as nature-based solutions to counter coastal eutrophication. © 2020, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Hydrologic knowledge in India has a historical footprint extending over several millenniums through the Harappan civilization (3000-1500 BCE) and the Vedic Period (1500-500 BCE). As in other ancient civilizations across the world, the need to manage water propelled the growth of hydrologic science in ancient India. Most of the ancient hydrologic knowledge, however, has remained hidden and unfamiliar to the world at large until the recent times. In this paper, we provide some fascinating glimpses into the hydrological, hydraulic, and related engineering knowledge that existed in ancient India, as discussed in contemporary literature and revealed by the recent explorations and findings. The Vedas, particularly, the Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda, have many references to the water cycle and associated processes, including water quality, hydraulic machines, hydro-structures, and nature-based solutions (NBS) for water management. The Harappan civilization epitomizes the level of development of water sciences in ancient India that includes construction of sophisticated hydraulic structures, wastewater disposal systems based on centralized and decentralized concepts, and methods for wastewater treatment. The Mauryan Empire ( 322-185 BCE) is credited as the first \"hydraulic civilization\" and is characterized by the construction of dams with spillways, reservoirs, and channels equipped with spillways (Pynes and Ahars); they also had an understanding of water balance, development of water pricing systems, measurement of rainfall, and knowledge of the various hydrological processes. As we investigate deeper into the references to hydrologic works in ancient Indian literature including the mythology, many fascinating dimensions of the Indian scientific contributions emerge. This review presents the various facets of water management, exploring disciplines such as history, archeology, hydrology and hydraulic engineering, and culture and covering the geographical area of the entire Indian subcontinent to the east of the Indus River. The review covers the period from the Mature Harappan Phase to the Vedic Period and the Mauryan Empire. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'Coastal flood risk facing urban communities is increasing due to the compound impacts of sea level rise (SLR) and urban growth. Accurate information on future dynamic risk of coastal flooding and its physical and socio-economic drivers is essential for planning effective and targeted adaptation. However, the current scenarios regarding urban development are insufficient to predict the future dynamic spatial distribution of urban socio-economic and physical growth, hindering the exact and dynamic assessment of future coastal flood risk. Moreover, the relative contributions of SLR and urban development to the future dynamics of city-level coastal flood risk have not been examined. Therefore, here we developed a land use-based urban growth scenario for the temporally and spatially explicit simulation of future urban growth in terms of buildings, roads and electrical facilities, and combined it with a local temporally explicit SLR scenario, into a “hazard-exposure-vulnerability” model, for the purpose of dynamic risk assessment of coastal flooding on the urban built environment in Xiamen, China by 2050, and accordingly examined the relative contributions of SLR and urban growth. Our results demonstrated a good performance of the land use-based urban growth model. SLR and urban growth will increase future coastal flood risk (represented by the expected annual damage, EAD) in varying degrees, but their combination is projected to exacerbate future flood damages significantly, indicating that considering either SLR or urban growth in isolation will underestimate future coastal flood risk. Moreover, the relative contributions of SLR and urban growth are dynamic over time, depending on the rate of SLR and the stage of urbanization: for example, the change in coastal flood risk is mainly attributable to urban growth in the phase of rapid urbanization before 2033 in Xiamen, yet the contribution of urban growth then becomes less important compared to SLR, when urbanization slows down, while SLR reaches a threshold after accelerating growth. The approach and results of our study can be considered a decision support tool, to help decision makers assess future coastal flood risk and detect the relative importance of each driving force, in order to employ land use planning, nature-based solutions and engineering protection, to achieve sustainable and resilient coastal cities. © 2021',\n",

       " 'As climate change continues to threaten human and natural systems, the search for cost-effective and practical mitigation solutions is gaining momentum. Reforestation has recently been identified as a promising nature-based climate solution. Yet there are context-dependent biophysical, financial, land-use and operational constraints to reforestation that demand careful consideration. Here, we show that 121 million ha of presently degraded land in Southeast Asia, a region noted for its significant reforestation potential, are biophysically suitable for reforestation. Reforestation of this land would contribute 3.43 ± 1.29 PgCO2e yr−1 to climate mitigation through 2030. However, by taking a combination of on-the-ground financial, land use and operational constraints into account, we find that only a fraction of that mitigation potential may be achievable (0.3–18%). Such constraints are not insurmountable, but they show that careful planning and consideration are needed for effective landscape-scale reforestation. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.',\n",
       " 'This study benchmarks vermifiltration (VF) as secondary wastewater treatment in three nature-based decentralized treatment plants using life-cycle assessment. The comparison is justified by the comparatively easier and cheaper operation of VF when compared to more traditional technologies, including small rate infiltration (SRI), constructed wetlands (CW), and activated sludge (AS). Standard life cycle assessment was used and applied to three case studies located in southern Europe. Material intensity during construction was highest for VF, but impacts during operation were lower, compensating those of the other phases. Impacts during the construction phase far outweigh those of operation and dismantling for facilities using constructed wetlands and activated sludge, when the number of served inhabitants is small, and due to lack of economies of scale. VF used as secondary treatment was shown to contribute to reducing the environmental impacts, mainly in constructed wetlands and activated sludge. The replacement of CW by VF seems to bring important environmental benefits in most impact categories, in particular in the construction phase. The replacement by VF in facilities with SRI seems to result in the improvement of some of the impact categories, in particular in the operation phase. As for dismantling, no conclusive results were obtained. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " \"Nature-based solutions (NbS), such as the implementation of environmental conservation and restoration as public works projects, require accurate and cost-effective assessments of the values related to the projects. The values should represent collective ecosystem services, individual services such as food provision and water purification, and other intangible services. To comprehensively assess such services, we proposed a novel method, which we call the comparative evaluation method. Our method is able to assess the value of each service category of an NbS project from a single questionnaire survey. Survey participants are asked to compare values of multiple services having anchoring prices. Our method determines the permissible economic value of environmental public works (PEP) in response to the quantity of service. The questionnaire results used for analysis are limited to those from respondents who made their PEP evaluation on the basis of their consideration of the appropriate expenditure of taxes. In addition, the method controls for the effect of the satisfaction that a person experiences from doing good deeds to reduce an overestimation of the values of services. Moreover, PEPs are not influenced by the respondent's annual income, age, sex, or educational background, and are based on personal values. Applying this new method, we surveyed residents of the watersheds of Tokyo Bay and Osaka Bay and evaluated nine ecosystem services. Overall, our new method is shown to be an effective method for evaluating the ecosystem services of NbS projects from the viewpoint of public works. © 2021 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Flow discharge and anthropogenic activities influence the composition and configuration of habitat patches in river ecosystems. Understanding the response of habitat landscapes and the corresponding fish habitat quality is crucial for river management. We investigated the reaction of fish habitat suitability and variant flow discharge performance in examining aquatic habitat patch fragmentation. The hydraulic simulation and fish habitat calculation were used to determine the flow characteristics, habitat conditions, and river landscapes. FRAGSTATS was applied to explore the composition and configuration of habitat patches. Cluster analysis and logistic regression were employed to compute the spatiotemporal variabilities of riverscape indices and establish the relationship between riverscape attributes and fish habitat quality. The results indicate that the changes in specific habitat features are associated with the riverscape indices of total edge (TE), mean nearest-neighbor distance (MNN), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), mean patch size (MPS), and area-weighted mean patch fractal dimension (AWMPFD). The flow discharge is the key to determining habitat fragmentation in rivers, with natural barriers occurring at low flow. In contrast, weirs are anthropogenic obstacles that have significant adverse effects on the downstream corridor. A priority restoration activity to conserve river habitat is to create refuge pools during dry seasons by modifying channel morphology. The positive correlation between habitat suitability and MPS and the negative relationship between habitat suitability and AWMPFD highlight the patch size and shape complexity that are critical indices for pool creation. The prediction of the landscape attributes of the outcomes under different scenarios could support the decision-making in river management. The innovative integrated method presented in this study provides a solid foundation and supports the implementation of nature-based solutions for sustainable river management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Mining and biomass waste were used to remediate a brownfield affected by As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn pollution in a pilot scale experiment, and a plant used for phytoremediation purposes was used as an indicator of possible toxicological effects. To carry out the experiments, plots in field conditions were treated with magnesite (mining waste), magnesite-sludge compost, and magnesite-biochar respectively, while untreated soil was used as a control. The plots were then irrigated and left for one week, after which seeds of the ryegrass Lolium perenne L. were sown. Soil properties such as metal(loid) availability, pH, phosphorus availability, total nitrogen, organic carbon, and nutrients were monitored for two months. Finally, the ryegrass was harvested and pollutant concentrations were analyzed in the aerial parts. Magnesite proved to be an excellent amendment for metal(loid) immobilization, although the notable increase in soil pH and Mg content inhibited plant growth. However, the application of magnesite in combination with the sludge compost (rich in N and P) favored plant growth and also immobilized metals, although As availability increased. In contrast, the analysis of plants in this treatment revealed lower As and metal concentrations than those grown in the untreated soil. In turn, the application of magnesite and biochar was also effective in reducing metal(loid) availability; however, the plants did not grow under these conditions, probably due to the low N and P content of biochar. In this regard, the combined application of mining waste and sludge compost emerges as a useful nature-based solution for soil remediation in the context of the circular economy. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR) but are also valued for their potential to provide effective nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Ecological benefits from these ecosystems can be constrained under urban settings by anthropogenic disturbances and pressures, so restoration activities are promoted as a management approach. Here we report on the potential for restoration of disused commercial salt extraction pans to enhance carbon (C) sequestration in the urban Swartkops Estuary, South Africa. We also considered the impact of SLR to 2100 on the distribution of estuarine habitats, the vulnerability of built infrastructure to tidal flooding, and how C sequestration is projected to change over time using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Potential restoration of all salt pans (320 ha) to estuarine habitat was estimated to result in a gain of 67 850 Mg C. Establishing tidal connectivity was investigated as a potential restoration action, but most of the salt pan area was above the elevation of the current tidal range and would require excavation. Although conversion of the salt pans to estuarine habitat was predicted to occur without intervention under SLR, 44% of the original area would remain unchanged. Restoring hydrological connectivity to the estuary for these salt pans would significantly increase the extent of transitional/floodplain marsh, even under SLR to 2100. C sequestration was predicted to be 15% higher (54 614.8 Mg C) by 2100 if the salt pans could be restored, compared to if no action is taken. Overall, restoration of the salt pans has the potential to enhance C sequestration, but SLR will still cause large losses of supratidal marsh due to ‘coastal squeeze’ and extensive tidal flooding of developed areas by 2100 in the lower reaches of the estuary. A full-scale restoration approach for the Swartkops Estuary could use C sequestration potential to fund the project through carbon offsetting if the revenue exceeds the cost of the restoration activities, but additional social and ecological goals also need to be incorporated if the outcome is to be holistic and beneficial. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"Nature exposure is known to promote life satisfaction and well-being, and indirect exposure through windows is likely to benefit isolated populations. However, whether such type of exposure can benefit prisoners, the extremely isolated population, is unknown. In the current study, we investigated 326 male prisoners from three prisons in southwest China. Psychological variables including depression, anxiety, loneliness, distress tolerance, life satisfaction, and well-being were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), short-form UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-6), Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), respectively. Structural equation modeling was employed to identify the pathways from the visibility of nature through windows to prisoners' life satisfaction and well-being. Our results demonstrated that visibility of nature promoted the frequency and duration of viewing nature through windows. The frequency directly affected well-being, but the duration did not effectively affect any measured variables. The visibility of nature enhanced life satisfaction mainly via direct effects but enhanced well-being mainly via indirect effects. Regarding the indirect pathways, the visibility of nature increased distress tolerance and thus reduced loneliness and mental health problems. The reduced mental health problem, in turn, promoted life satisfaction and well-being. Our findings suggest that nature exposure through windows is effective in enhancing prisoners' life satisfaction and well-being. The policymaker may need to consider nature-based solutions such as indirect nature exposure in prions to benefit isolated populations. Copyright © 2021 Li, Zhang, You, Chen, Cao and Zhang.\",\n",
       " \"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to tremendous impacts on human lives and society, which are not only because of negative effects on people's mental health due to isolation policies and physical distance for mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but also because the incident post-acute sequelae of the coronavirus will cause mental disorders. A green environment is a health resource, which cannot only benefit human physical and mental health, but also increases biodiversity, contributes to flood mitigation, and cools urban areas. A home garden, as a kind of small green space, can provide ecosystem services with eco-healing functions in reducing mental stress during the isolation period of the COVID-19 pandemic through the garden itself and physical activities in it. Such an eco-healing approach within a mini-therapeutic landscape can also benefit biodiversity by enhancing plant diversity in residence and increasing biodiversity at a large scale. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework describing a home garden as “ecological medicine” with healing functions to improve mental health, as well as indirectly enhancing urban biodiversity. A home garden, as a mini-type of green landscape with biodiversity content, allows people to get close with nature so that it can promote comfortable and natural feelings during the pandemic. Furthermore, such an eco-healing home garden approach benefiting urban biodiversity can meet the challenges in maintaining environmental and mental health in post COVID-19 pandemic recovery, as well as preparing unknown next-surge risks with potential isolation regulations.

       " 'Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are cost-effective systems for the remediation of polluted water. In FTWs, the metabolic activity of microorganisms associated with plants is fundamental to treatment efficiency. Bioaugmentation, the addition of microorganisms with pollutant-degrading capabilities, appears to be a promising means to enhance the treatment efficiency of FTWs. Here, we quantified the effect of bioaugmentation with a four-membered bacterial consortium on the remediation of water contaminated with crude oil in pilot-scale FTWs planted with Phragmites australis or Typha domingensis. The bacteria had been isolated from the endosphere and rhizosphere of various plants and carry the alkane hydroxylase gene, alkB, involved in aerobic hydrocarbon degradation. During a treatment period of 36 days, FTWs planted with P. australis achieved a reduction in hydrocarbon concentration from 300 mg/L to 16 mg/L with and 56 mg/L without bioaugmentation. In the FTWs planted with T. domingensis, respective hydrocarbon concentrations were 46 mg/L and 84 mg/L. The inoculated bacteria proliferated in the rhizoplane and in the plant interior. Copy numbers of the alkB gene and its mRNA increased over time in plant-associated samples, suggesting increased bacterial hydrocarbon degradation. The results show that bioaugmentation improved the treatment of oil-contaminated water in FTWs by at least a factor of two, indicating that the performance of full-scale systems can be improved at only small costs. © 2021 by the authors.

Since 2015, the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda has provided UN member states with goals, targets, and indicators to facilitate an integrated approach focusing on economic, environmental, and social improvements simultaneously. The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of fluvial NBSs to the UN 2030 Agenda, using all its components: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), targets, and indicators. We propose a four‐step framework with inputs from the UN 2030 Agenda, scientific literature, and case studies. The framework provides a set of fluvial flooding indicators that are linked to SDG indicators of the UN 2030 Agenda. Finally, the fluvial flooding indicators are tested by applying them to a case study, the Eddleston Water Project, aiming to examine its contribution to the UN 2030 Agenda. This reveals that the Eddleston Water Project contributes to 9 SDGs and 33 SDG targets from environmental, economic, societal, policy, and technical perspectives. Our framework aims to enhance the systematic considerations of the SDG indicators, adjust their notion to the system of interest, and thereby enhance the link between the sustainability performance of NBSs and the UN 2030 Agenda. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Reconciling erosion control and flood prevention with restoration of diversity is an im-portant challenge for our societies today. However, examples of applications remain rare because practitioners and engineers are searching for more integrated solutions for this kind of situation. New considerations should, therefore, refocus attention on developing innovative actions by raising the question of how best to accommodate the two components. Moreover, little attention has been paid to erosion processes and their control for decreasing floods, although this can largely contribute to this purpose. Merging security with ecology, turning to co-benefits nature-based solutions at the catchment scale, based on the use of local ecological engineering, especially soil and water bioengineering combined with civil engineering, can provide adapted practices for harmonizing flood prevention and erosion control with restoration of biodiversity at the water catchment scale. This kind of approach should be accompanied by proposals for coherent and adapted governance for application of co-benefits nature-based solutions at the catchment and territory scales. © 2021 by the author.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) are seen as a promising adaptation measure that sustainably deals with diverse societal challenges, while simultaneously delivering multiple benefits. Nature-based solutions have been highlighted as a resilient and sustainable means of mitigating floods and other hazards globally. This study examined diverging conceptualizations of NBS, as well as the attitudinal (for example, emotions and beliefs) and contextual (for example, legal and political aspects) barriers and drivers of NBS for flood risks in South Korea. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 11 experts and focused on the topic of flood risk measures and NBS case studies. The analysis found 11 barriers and five drivers in the attitudinal domain, and 13 barriers and two drivers in the contextual domain. Most experts see direct monetary benefits as an important attitudinal factor for the public. Meanwhile, the cost-effectiveness of NBS and their capacity to cope with flood risks were deemed influential factors that could lead decision makers to opt for NBS. Among the contextual factors, insufficient systems to integrate NBS in practice and the ideologicalization of NBS policy were found to be peculiar barriers, which hinder consistent realization of initiatives and a long-term national plan for NBS. Understanding the barriers and drivers related to the mainstreaming of NBS is critical if we are to make the most of such solutions for society and nature.

       " 'Historic land degradation is an ongoing threat to the Sky Islands of southern Arizona, US, and northern Sonora, Mexico, an area designated as a globally significant biodiversity hotspot. Land degradation has reduced ecosystem services provisioning, released carbon from disturbed soils into the atmosphere, and significantly diminished resilience to climate change. Private land managers in the region have developed methods to reverse degradation and restore biodiversity and ecosystem function. Land managers have used rock detention structures (RDS), technology adapted from traditional Indigenous practices in the region, as a tool for reversing desertification and watershed degradation. The structures were installed primarily for erosion control and water management, but they have had positive impacts on multiple biophysical systems. In this study, we analyze watershed-scale installation of RDS as a nature-based solution for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Case studies include four properties that offer examples of structures that have been in place over a period ranging from 1 to 40\\xa0years. We reviewed journal articles and other studies conducted at the four sites, supplemented with interviews, to catalogue the nature-based solutions provided by RDS. This study documents positive impacts on overall stream flow, reduction in peak runoff during inundation events, and increased sedimentation, which increase resilience to drought, erosion, and flooding. Data suggest potential impacts for climate change mitigation, though further research is needed. In addition, results suggest that watershed restoration with RDS offers a host of co-benefits, including an increase in biodiversity and wildlife abundance, an increase in vegetative cover, and increased surface water provisioning over time to support the land-based livelihoods of downstream neighbors. In the discussion, we consider barriers to replication and scalability using the strategy of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration as a guiding framework, discussing issues of awareness, legislation and policy, technical capacity, finance, and gaps in knowledge. © Copyright © 2021 Gooden and Pritzlaff.',\n",

Regularly updating the NFPP is a must for sustainable enviro-socio-economic development. SUMMARY In order to improve environmental conditions and the well-being of its population, China has implemented one of the world's largest ecological rehabilitation projects of the early twenty-first century: The Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP). This program aims to prevent deforestation and conserve natural forests, mainly by banning logging. With heavy central government financing, the NFPP has profound global ecological and socioeconomic impacts. While most previous studies have focused on the positive aspects of the NFPP, some negative aspects should also be examined. Chiefly, the NFPP does not fully address the untapped potential of the natural forest and the uses of this sustainable economic resource, which should be approached using nature-based solutions. Some major policy points in the NFPP, such as forest management, institutional design, diversified funding resources, and comprehensive monitoring, need revision.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NbS) have been positioned and implemented in urban areas as solutions for enhancing urban resilience in the face of a wide range of urban challenges. However, there is a lack of recommendations of optimal NbS and appropriate typologies fitting to different contexts and urban design. The analytical frameworks for NbS implementation and impact evaluation, that integrate NbS into local policy frameworks, socio-economic transition pathways, and spatial planning, remain fragmented. In this article, the NbS concept and its related terminologies are first discussed. Second, the types of NbS implemented in Europe are reviewed and their benefits over time are explored, prior to categorizing them and highlighting the key methods, criteria, and indicators to identify and assess the NbS’s impacts, co-benefits, and trade-offs. The latter involved a review of the websites of 52 projects and some relevant publications funded by EU Research and Innovation programs and other relevant publications. The results show that there is a shared understanding that the NbS concept encompasses benefits of restoration and rehabilitation of ecosystems, carbon neutrality, improved environmental quality, health and well-being, and evidence for such benefits. This study also shows that most NbS-related projects and activities in Europe use hybrid approaches, with NbS typically developed, tested, or implemented to target specific types of environmental–social–economic challenges. The results of this study indicate that NbS as a holistic concept would be beneficial in the context of climate action and sustainable solutions to enhance ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity within cities.

       " 'Blue and Green Infrastructure (BGI) provide one of the key Nature Based Solution (NBS) approaches for sustainable stormwater management in cities, in conjunction with extending the scope of Ecosystem Services (ES). In both the process of planning and designing highly urbanized areas, the implementation of BGI is important for the improvement of living conditions and counteracting the negative effects of climate change. Based on the literature review, 19 BGI solutions were identified and then valorized in relation to the following three key aspects: spatial and functional, environmental, and social. The results of the assessment were derived using the scoring method and allowed for the identification of BGI solutions with a high, medium or low value for shaping sustainable urban public spaces. Using the potential of analyzed BGI solutions to improve the functioning and attractiveness of urban areas requires a comprehensive approach. Conscious planning and designing should use the knowledge presented to make the implementation of BGI solutions as effective as possible in relation to the above-mentioned aspects of shaping urban public spaces. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we gather and integrate robust geospatial datasets from the social, ecological, environmental, and hydrologic domains using seamless, cloud‐based data services to facilitate the trans‐disciplinary assessment of NBSs as a function of society and Earth. This research enhances practical decision making and research by assimilating web‐based datasets and describing the missing links between national policy and robust adoption of NBSs as a sustainability solution. This NSDI serves to foster participatory planning capabilities and integrate local sustainability goals into decision–support frameworks. Such a platform strengthens the knowledge base necessary for addressing multiple, co‐evolving issues of societal relevance, an essential component of fully es-pousing NBSs within the realm of socio‐technological systems and improving policies and implementation regarding sustainable solutions. The efficacy of the proposed platform to serve as a ho-listic data information system is assessed by exploring important characteristics associated with geospatial NSDI tools, namely, openness, spatial functionality, scalability, and standardization. By placing GIS strengths and weaknesses in the context of transdisciplinary NBSs, we reveal strategic directions toward further co‐production of such NSDIs.

       " 'Most of the studies about stormwater low-impact development technologies (LID) used generalized observations without fully understanding the mechanisms affecting the whole performance of the systems from the catchment to the facility itself. At present, these LID technologies have been treated as black box due to fluctuating flow and environmental conditions affecting its operation and treatment performance. As such, the implications of microbial community to the overall performance of the tree-box filter (TBF) were investigated in this study. Based on the results, summer season was found to be the most suitable season for microorganism growth as greater microorganism count was found in TBF during this season compared to other seasons. Least microorganism count was found in spring which might have been affected by the plant growth during this season since plant penology influences the seasonal dynamics of soil microorganisms. Litterfall during fall season might have affected the microorganism count during winter as, during this season, the compositional variety of soil organic matter changes affecting growth of soil microbial commu-nities. Microbial analyses of soil samples collected in TBF revealed that the most dominant microorganism phylum is Proteobacteria in all the seasons in both inlet and outlet comprising 37% to 47% of the total microorganism count. Proteobacteria is of great importance to carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycling in soil. Proteobacteria was followed by Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi which comprises 6% to 20%, 9% to 20%, and 2% to 27%, respectively, of the total microorganism count for each season. Each microorganism phylum was found to have varying correlation to different soil chemical parameters implying the effects of these parameters to microorganism survival in LID technologies. Depending on the target biogeochemical cycle, maintaining a good environment for a specific microbial phylum may be decided. These findings were useful in optimizing the design and performance of tree box filters considering physical, chemical, and biological pollutant removal mechanisms. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Ecosystem services are increasingly being considered in decision-making with respect to mitigating future climate impacts. In this respect, there is a clear need to identify how nature-based solutions (NBS) can benefit specific ecosystem services, in particular within the complex spatial and temporal dynamics that characterize most river catchments. To capture these changes, ecosystem models require spatially explicit data that are often difficult to obtain for model development and validation. Citizen science allows for the participation of trained citizen volunteers in research or regulatory activities, resulting in increased data collection and increased participation of the general public in resource management. Despite the increasing experience in citizen science, these approaches have seldom been used in the modeling of provisioning ecosystem services. In the present study, we examined the temporal and spatial drivers in nutrient delivery in a major Italian river catchment and under different NBS scenarios. Information on climate, land use, soil and river conditions, as well as future climate scenarios, were used to explore future (2050) benefits of NBS on local and catchment scale nutrient loads and nutrient export. We estimate the benefits of a reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus export to the river and the receiving waters (Adriatic Sea) with respect to the costs associated with individual and combined NBS approaches related to river restoration and catchment reforestation. © 2021 by the authors.

The Amanalco-Valle de Bravo Basin reservoir is the major freshwater supply for Mexico City. By measuring physical-chemical and bacteriological parameters in creeks over 21 months and correlating them to land use areas, it was possible to understand the impacts of different land uses (urban, forest, riparian forests, and different agricultural systems) in water quality. The results show that the concentration of E. coli, nitrates, nitrites, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and total suspended solids were higher than the recommended reference levels, and that average oxygen saturation and alkalinity were lower than the recommended reference levels in most sites. The analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong relationship between water pollution and urban and agricultural land uses, specifically a higher impact of potato cultivation, due to its intensive use of agrochemicals and downhill tilling. There was a clear positive relationship between total forest area and riparian vegetation cover with improved water quality, validating their potential as nature-based solutions for the regulation of water quality. The results of the present study indicate the opportunities that better land management practices generate to ensure communities’ and water ecosystems’ health. This study also highlights the benefits of citizen science as a tool for raising awareness with regard to water quality and nature-based solutions, and as an appropriate tool for participative watershed management. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Faced with sea level rise and the intensification of extreme events, human populations living on the coasts are developing responses to address local situations. A synthesis of the literature on responses to coastal adaptation allows us to highlight different adaptation strategies. Here, we analyze these strategies according to the complexity of their implementation, both institutionally and technically. First, we distinguish two opposing paradigms – fighting against rising sea levels or adapting to new climatic conditions; and second, we observe the level of integrated management of the strategies. This typology allows a distinction between four archetypes with the most commonly associated governance modalities for each. We then underline the need for hybrid approaches and adaptation trajectories over time to take into account local socio-cultural, geographical, and climatic conditions as well as to integrate stakeholders in the design and implementation of responses. We show that dynamic and participatory policies can foster collective learning processes and enable the evolution of social values and behaviors. Finally, adaptation policies rely on knowledge and participatory engagement, multi-scalar governance, policy monitoring, and territorial solidarity. These conditions are especially relevant for densely populated areas that will be confronted with sea level rise, thus for coastal cities in particular.

       " 'Casuarina equisetifolia plantations have been widely established along tropical and subtropical coasts, where they act as a windbreak to shelter coastal areas. These shelter plantations also fulfill another important ecosystem service by sequestering large amounts of carbon (C). However, shelter plantations are usually established on nutrient-poor sand dunes, which may limit tree growth and therefore C sequestration rates. To assess whether fertilization increases the C sequestration of coastal shelter plantations, we conducted a fertilization experiment in a young C. equisetifolia plantation with four treatments: nitrogen addition (+N), phosphorus addition (+P), nitrogen and phosphorus addition (+NP), and controls (CK). We quantified nutrient availability and annual net ecosystem production (NEP) during the key early establishment phase. Fertilization with +N and +P significantly increased ammonium-N and extractable P in the surface soils and the N and P concentrations of branches, respectively. Surprisingly, the mean growth rate of C. equisetifolia plantations (24.59 ± 0.66 Mg ha−1\\xa0yr−1) was not affected by fertilization. The mean NEP was 6.18 ± 0.49 Mg C ha−1\\xa0yr−1, and there was no difference among fertilization treatments. However, soil organic C significantly increased by 41% and 36% with +N and +P, respectively, but not +NP. C. equisetifolia plantations can sequester large amounts of C in biomass on poor soils without the need for additional nutrients, although fertilization may enhance soil C storage. Considering the potential large planting area, we suggest that coastal C. equisetifolia shelter plantations could be an important nature-based solution for climate change mitigation in coastal regions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",
       " 'The adoption of both Nature-based Solutions (NbS) and a system perspective is a hot issue and an area in which there is much room for improvement in ecological protection and restoration. The study takes Altay region as an example, an area located in Xinjiang, China, which is an important ecological corridor of the national key functional area and the core area of the Belt and Road but has a fragile ecological environment and needs much enhancement in ecological protection and restoration. Guided by the concept of \"mountains-rivers-forests- farmlands-lakes-grasslands (MRFFLG) system is a life community\", the coupling relationship of the various MRFFLG elements, the main ecological environmental problems and the integrated countermeasures for protection and restoration in Altay region have been analyzed in this study. The study shows that Altay region has a typical meta-ecosystem of mountain, oasis, and desert, and the connections by rivers and lakes make the ecosystem links within the region much closer. The interweaving of resource-environmental-ecological issues of the aquatic ecosystem, degradation of the quality of terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and farmlands, the increased ecosystem fragmentation and ecological risks are the major ecological environmental issues in this region. This study takes the improvement of the ecosystem health and function in Altay region as the core goal of regional ecological protection and restoration. First, we establish a zoning governance pattern from the perspective of ecosystem integrity; second, we design governance strategies for different zones with the goal of synergistic improvements in the ecosystem functions; and finally, we clarify the key engineering tasks in different zones from the perspective of ecosystem services. Ecological conservation and restoration of the MRFFLG system is a prime example of the application and development of NbS in China. This paper constructs an analytical framework for identifying regional life communities, diagnosing ecological protection and restoration of zoning problems, and proposing classified solutions for ecological protection tasks for the protection of the MRFFLG system. This research will enrich the theory and technology for the protection and restoration of MRFFLG systems, and provide guidance for the practice of ecological protection and restoration in Altay region. © 2021, Science Press.

       " 'Ecofriendly and economic nature-based technologies that use plants as a key system component are becoming feasible for wastewater treatment. Epipremnum aureum is considered a promising plant candidate due to its robustness, easy propagation, perennial growth, fibrous roots, growth with minimal nutrients and light, and phytoremediation potential from the air and water media. This study aimed to systemically evaluate the nutrients removal capability of E. aureum from different waste streams. Within 30 days incubation period, E. aureum achieved removal (in mg/gplant biomass) of 6.0 ± 0.6, 4.8 ± 0.4 and 3.5 ± 0.2 for total nitrogen and 0.31 ± 0.05, 0.30 ± 0.04 and 0.27 ± 0.09 for total phosphorous from primary treated domestic wastewater, secondary effluent, and greywater, respectively. The majority of removal occurred within the initial 15 days. Linked to the nutrient removal, there was the highest growth and leaf chlorophyll content in domestic wastewater (5.2 ± 0.2 g and 0.9 ± 0.1 mg/gtissue), followed by secondary effluent (4.1 ± 0.3 g and 0.9 ± 0.1 mg/gtissue) and minimum in greywater (1.5 ± 0.1 g and 0.6 ± 0.1 mg/gtissue). Mixing showed no significant effect on nutrients removal, while static conditions favored TN removal. E. aureum showed preferential uptake of ammonium than nitrate during the initial growth stages. These results support using E. aureum in nature-based technologies for nutrients removal from different wastewaters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'The subject of the article concerns vertical urban farms that play an important role in naturebased solutions and ecosystem services for the city. In the face of a changing climate, progressive environmental degradation, and the related loss of agricultural land, vertical farms can be seen as an alternative to traditional agriculture. Woven into the blue-green infrastructure of cities, they may not only constitute a base for food production, but can also create a new valuable ecological, social, and economic hub in contemporary cities, changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this paper is to show whether it is possible to introduce various functions which support ecosystem and social services, and whether they affect measurable benefits for urban residents in a large-scale system of solutions in the field of vertical urban agriculture. This research shows that urban vertical farms can perform many functions and bring diverse benefits to the inhabitants of cities. In a multi-scale system, they allow for the creation of patchwork connections, which stabilise a specific city biome in the vertical space. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly addressed in urban planning and research to enhance urban sustainability and resilience through the provisioning of ecosystem services (ES). Yet, few applications exist of planning models for multifunctional GI in high spatial and thematic detail that simultaneously align with stakeholder interests. We address these gaps by developing and presenting a spatially explicit model to inform urban planners on priority areas for multifunctional GI development. This model was made possible by spatial analyses on multiple scales, enabling us to assess ES in sufficient detail, while simultaneously matching the preferences for scale and ES-indicators of decision makers and urban planners. The model involves a novel weighting scheme based upon the local capacity of GI to mitigate problems. We applied our model to the city of The Hague using a set of three policy-relevant problems: air pollution, the urban heat island effect and storm water flooding. Our results show that the capacity of GI to mitigate these problems varies spatially, both within and between ES, and depends on local characteristics of GI and the environmental context. We illustrate the relevance of using a multi-scale approach in spatial ES analysis, and underline that GI planning measures should be assessed in high spatial detail due to their often locally distinct ES capacity. Our approach makes important strides towards the deployment of nature-based solutions for urban challenges in the light of demands for increasing resilience and sustainability. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'Sustainability requires chemical processes to respect ecological constraints. Toward meeting this requirement, the idea of including ecosystems as unit operations in process design has been introduced in previous work. To make this idea more practical, this work develops a constructed wetland (CW) simulation module for use in the process simulation tool CHEMCAD. By simulating various combinations of an anaerobic bioreactor (ABR) technology and a CW ecosystem for water treatment, this work shows that CW is most cost-effective if adequate land area is available. Otherwise, a series arrangement with the ABR before the CW makes the most sense. This result introduces a potential design heuristic that technology is better suited than a nature-based solution for a higher concentration of waste. Integrated designs show that cost-effective designs reduce the separation load on distillation by relying more on the lower-cost CW. Recycling water makes economic sense only if the cost of water increases. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Sub-Saharan African crop production largely relies on smallholder farms, located both in urban and agricultural landscapes. In this context, the investigation of plant and pollinator diversity and their interactions is of primary importance since both these factors are threatened by land use intensification and the consequent loss of natural habitats. In this study, we evaluated for the first time how plant and pollinator insect assemblages and interactions in Sub-Saharan farming conditions are shaped by land use intensification. To do that, we complemented biodiversity field surveys in Northern Tanzania with a modern DNA metabarcoding approach to characterize the foraged plants and thus built networks describing plant-pollinator interactions at the individual insect level. Moreover, we coupled this information with quantitative traits of landscape composition and floral availability surrounding each farm. We found that pollinator richness decreased with increasing impervious and agricultural cover in the landscape, whereas the flower density at each farm correlated with pollinator richness. The intensification of agricultural land use and urbanization correlated with a higher foraging niche overlap among pollinators due to convergence of individuals’ flower visiting strategies. Furthermore, within farms, the higher availability of floral resources drove lower niche overlap among individuals, while a greater flower visitors abundance shaped higher generalization at the networks level (H2′), possibly due to increased competition. These mechanistic understandings leading to individuals’ foraging niche overlap and generalism at the network level, could imply stability of interactions and of the pollination ecosystem service. Our integrative survey proved that plant-pollinator systems are largely affected by land use intensification and by local factors in smallholder farms of Sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, policies promoting nature-based solutions, among which the introduction of more pollinator-friendly practices by smallholder farmers, could be effective in mitigating the intensification of both urban and rural landscapes in this region, as well as in similar Sub-Saharan contexts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Due to Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm., high abundance in Novi Sad (Serbia) and previously confirmed biodiesel feedstock suitability, this study aimed to assess generative potential and yield, assess K. paniculata invasive risk, and investigate the influence of harvesting periods on the oil content and quality. Fifty-five specimens present in the Novi Sad inner-city core exhibited very high scores in the conducted invasiveness risk assessment (score 35/39). Determined good overall adaptability, growth and development, vitality and decorativeness of K. paniculata specimens, as well as the absence of phytopathological and entomological damages, due to lack of natural enemies, provided this species high unhindered yielding. The majority of investigated trees reached 5–10 m in height and canopy volumes from 10.1 to 70 m3, with an estimated more than 130 000–700 000 seeds produced per canopy. Seeds from one representative specimen were collected on different harvesting dates, at the end of August, September and October of 2019, and analyzed for oil content and quality for biodiesel production. With the average oil percentage of 22.8 w%, determined in the representative specimen, investigated 55 seed-bearing K. paniculata trees merely in the inner city core of Novi Sad, could produce 115 kg of oil. Since oil properties (&lt;1 w% of free fatty acids and the acid number &lt;2 mgKOH.g−1) and fatty acid profile (high content of monounsaturated fatty acids ≈72 w%) fit the requirements set in EN14214 biodiesel standard, regardless of the harvest date, harvest season can be extended to at least three months without compromising the oil quality for biodiesel production. Thus, intrinsic disservice of K. paniculata – high seed yielding can be shifted into a novel ecosystem service – quality biodiesel production. Aiming to avoid viable seed deposition in the ground and formation of the invasive seed bank, early August harvest can be recommended. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'In many parts of the world wastewater is not treated at all or only to a limited extend because there are no resources available to establish an efficient wastewater treatment plant and there are also insufficient resources for operation and maintenance costs. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are nature-based solutions to treat wastewater in a highly cost-efficient manner. They can be very efficient and effective when well designed and maintained. Latin America is rich in saline natural wetlands. These can be used as prototypes for CWs treating saline process or wastewater. Similar to natural saline wetlands CWs can deliver several ecosystem services. This review focuses on saline wetlands and will first present the protagonists, the salt-tolerant plant species belonging to the halophytes with respect to their physiological and biochemical functions in wetlands. In a second step, their remediating activities which are used in many ways by local people will be shown in an exemplary manner. A number of CWs established in different regions, including Latin America, will be introduced as case studies. Halophytes are already being used in a number of CWs as biofilter but their usage could be increased, for example to treat aquaculture effluents and the biomass has a high potential for valuable compounds (i.e. metabolites) or for bioenergy production. Lastly, aspects of sustainability and ecosystem services of saline natural and constructed wetlands are shown with an emphasis on charting a way forward for the future holistic implementation of saline systems in Latin America. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'There is growing evidence that traditional response to floods and flood-related disaster is no longer achieving desirable results. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) represent a relatively new response towards disaster risk reduction, water security, and resilience to climate change, which has a potential to be more effective and sustainable than traditional measures. However, in practice, these measures are still being applied at a slow rate while traditional grey infrastructure remains as a preferred choice. This can be attributed to several barriers which range from political and governance to social and technological/technical. More generally, there is a lack of sufficient knowledge base to accelerate their wider acceptance and uptake. The present work provides contribution in this direction and addresses the question of effectiveness of different types of NBS (i.e., small- and large-scale NBS) and their hybrid combinations with grey infrastructure. The work has been applied on the case of Ayutthaya, Thailand. The results suggest that the effectiveness of small-scale NBS is limited to smaller rainfall events whereas the larger (or extreme) events necessitate combinations of different kinds of measures with different scales of implementation (i.e., hybrid measures). © 2021',\n",
       " 'Riverine ecosystems form a dendritic network in which landscape and catchment-scale properties influence freshwater community structure. Placed in a restoration framework, this suggests that regional drivers can overrule the benefit of measures aiming at improving local habitat quality. Disentangling the relative influence of local and regional drivers on freshwater communities is thus crucial for ecosystem management and restoration. Along riverbanks, soil bioengineering is often used to both control erosion and improve ecological conditions. Soil bioengineering techniques aim at copying naturally functioning riverbank models and can thus be viewed as riparian ecosystem restoration. Nevertheless, these techniques are mostly designed at the local scale and are implemented in a broad range of rivers. This implies large variations in regional drivers, which may greatly influence the response of freshwater communities to restoration efforts. We studied 37 riverbanks, from civil engineering to soil bioengineering, plus natural willow stands, in the foothills of the Alps and Jura Mountains, and assessed the relative influence of local (terrestrial and aquatic habitat conditions) and regional (water quality, hydrological context and land cover composition) drivers on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Using multivariate GLM and structural equation modelling, we investigated variations in the taxonomic and functional composition and in the diversity of native, exotic, shredder and scraper taxa to both set of drivers. Our results showed that soil bioengineering improved local habitat conditions, with an increase in the vegetation density and in the aquatic habitat quality. These changes directly influenced functional composition but indirectly diversity patterns. Instead, we found that native and shredder species richness increased between civil engineered and soil bioengineered structures, suggesting a positive effect of vegetated riverbanks on other local abiotic factors (i.e. shade, water temperature, organic matter supply). Our results also showed that macroinvertebrates were more influenced by regional than by local drivers. Thus, the hydrological context best explained the composition of taxa feeding habits and variation in taxa diversity, with larger abundance and richness of scrapers and shredders in small headwater streams. Land cover ranked second in explaining variation in functional composition. Also, the diversity of natives, scrapers and shredders increased as the proportion of predominantly urban landscapes decreased. Finally, the abundance of scraper and native species increased with water quality, while the richness of exotic species decreased. Overall, these results highlight the hierarchical structure of local and regional drivers on freshwater communities. Along river networks, catchment-scale properties and landscape attributes are major drivers of macroinvertebrate assemblages. Soil bioengineering improves habitat quality and as such appears to be a good compromise solution to control erosion and support freshwater communities, even though this nature-based solution cannot solve anthropogenic pressures at larger scales. To improve the efficiency of restoration efforts, integrated approaches accounting for both local and regional drivers remains a priority. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Surface water flooding poses significant threats to communities and environments. This threat has historically been managed through sewers and combined sewer overflows; however, it is now well recognised that, alone, these legacy systems are insufficient to manage the growing pressures from climate change, population growth and urbanisation. This realisation has led to research and practice developing a broad range of new technologies to enhance the coping capacities of existing sewer systems through capturing and attenuating or reusing surface water across catchments using sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). However, despite technical understanding, industry champions and significant best practice, SuDS remain underutilised, particularly at a synergistic catchment scale where they can be most effective. In this paper we respond to this challenge by developing preliminary screening tools to enhance the visibility of SuDS among the multidisciplinary decision-makers responsible for directing strategic surface water management. We achieve this through upscaling a regional decision support model and demonstrating implementation across a case study in South West England. We find that it is possible to use easily accessible and open-source data to provide initial indications of SuDS opportunities and that this early visibility in the decision-making process can be used to support the consideration of novel and effective surface water management strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

For this reason, cities are required to adopt measures to reduce these impacts and tree planting has been suggested as a cost-effective strategy. In our study, we implemented for the first time in a Southern Caucasus city the i-Tree Eco model to quantify the main ecosystem services provided by urban forests. Trees in two parks in Tbilisi, EXPO Park (694 trees) and RED Park (1030 trees), have been measured, and a model simulation was performed for the year 2018. These green infrastructures store large amounts of carbon in their woody tissues (198.4 t for EXPO Park and 126.5 t for RED Park) and each year they sequester 4.6 and 4.7 t of CO2 for EXPO Park and RED Park. They also remove 119.6 and 90.3 kg of pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, SO2), and reduce water runoff of 269.5 and 200.5 m3, respectively.

       " \"The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims for clean water and sanitation for all by 2030, through eight subgoals dealing with four themes: (i) water quantity and availability, (ii) water quality, (iii) finding sustainable solutions and (iv) policy and governance. In this opinion paper, we assess how soils and associated land and water management can help achieve this goal, considering soils at two scales: local soil health and healthy landscapes. The merging of these two viewpoints shows the interlinked importance of the two scales. Soil health reflects the capacity of a soil to provide ecosystem services at a specific location, taking into account local climate and soil conditions. Soil is also an important component of a healthy and sustainable landscape, and they are connected by the water that flows through the soil and the transported sediments. Soils are linked to water in two ways: through plant-available water in the soil (green water) and through water in surface bodies or available as groundwater (blue water). In addition, water connects the soil scale and the landscape scale by flowing through both. Nature-based solutions at both soil health and landscape-scale can help achieve sustainable future development but need to be embedded in good governance, social acceptance and economic viability.

       " 'Non-technical summary Tropical deforestation continues apace despite a proliferation of commitments made by companies and governments to control it. Halting and reversing deforestation requires multiple, complementary interventions by state and non-state actors at different scales. We argue that the order in which these instruments and actors are introduced into the policy mix matters. Sequences of interventions from case studies in Latin America show that government commitment is a critical first step, implemented through command-and-control measures and then incentives. Combined with REDD+, they create an enabling environment for supply chain initiatives. A more coordinated and deliberate polycentric governance is needed to achieve zero-deforestation. Technical summary Avoided deforestation provides a natural climate solution for reducing emissions while generating co-benefits for people and nature. However, unleashing this potential requires improved governance. Diverse coalitions of actors are designing interventions to protect forests, each with different motivations and specialization of strategies. We introduce a policy sequencing framework to advance our understanding of how to improve polycentric zero-deforestation governance. Focusing on commodity production in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Colombia, we reconstructed the policy mix of zero-deforestation interventions across three domains - domestic public policies, REDD+, and supply chain initiatives. We classified interventions according to their instrument mechanism - disincentives, incentives, enabling measures - and when they were introduced into the policy mix. We found a sequence of interventions that reflects stages of forest cover dynamics, but also depends on local political will and institutional capacity. Government command-and-control measures are needed early in the policy sequence to slow deforestation, with incentives added to increase legal compliance. REDD+ helps governments build an enabling environment that supports supply chain initiatives seeking to increase forest cover at later stages of the sequence. Policy sequencing and policyscape concepts advance the design of more deliberate polycentric forest governance that enhances actor coordination and instrument synergies in the policy mix.

       " 'Climate change has induced sea-level rise and a high intensity of storms, which create high nearshore waves. These caused severe mangrove degradation and erosion along the coastal wetland areas in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Mangroves in the coastal wetland foreshore can withstand only some certain design storm waves and grow under several certain submerged conditions. Therefore, reducing waves and shallowing wetland elevation for recovering mangroves and protecting them in an early birth state is important. Bamboo or melaleuca fences have been used as a nature-based solution to reduce waves and currents approaching the shore for these above purposes along Vietnamese Mekong deltaic coasts. This paper investigates wave transmission through the bamboo fence system and assesses its effectiveness in protecting the mangroves. Waves were simultaneously measured at two locations for comparison: in front of and behind the fences. The result shows that the wave reduction by the fences is considerable, and sedimentation occurs rapidly in the shelter areas behind the fences, which is highly favorable for the recovery and growth of mangroves. Next, the empirical formulae have been proposed for relationships between the wave transmission coefficient of the fence and the dimensionless wave-structures parameters, such as the relative water depth, the wave steepness, and the fence freeboard. The findings create a basic technical reference for designing a naturally friendly-based solution by using bamboo and/or wooden fences in coastal protection generally and protecting mangroves specifically. The outcome of the research contributes to narrowing an existing gap in Vietnamese design guidelines for coastal wetland protection and also facilitates the use of locally available eco-friendly materials for coastal management along the Vietnamese Mekong delta coasts. © Copyright © 2021 Mai Van, Ngo, Mai and Dao.',\n",
       " \"Even if the ecological role of trees outside forests (TOF) is acknowledged, few studies provide an exhaustive census and define their principal characteristics, considering not only the patch size but also the effect of the surrounding land-use type on TOF biodiversity. Using a multiphase sampling design, we provided a map showing the spatial distribution of small woodlots outside forest (SWOF), a type of TOF, embedded in different land-use types in Sardinia, a Mediterranean hotspot of biodiversity conservation. Once located and mapped, we investigated the differences among SWOFs enclosed in different land-use types, in terms of vegetation structure and plant species richness (native and alien), searching for indicator species able to characterize SWOFs located in different land-use types. Hence, we explored the effect of environmental factors and vegetation structure on native and alien contingent in SWOF's plant communities. Our findings indicated that SWOFs were widely spread along the land-use intensification gradient, both in natural and human-modified land-use types. The area covered by SWOFs increased following the gradient of land-use intensification, reaching the highest value in urban zones (0.85%), and the lower in agricultural and natural and semi-natural areas (0.31% and 0.23%, respectively). We found dissimilarities between SWOFs located in different land-use types in terms of species richness, composition and indicator species, both native and alien. Notably, the contribution of alien species to the overall diversity was low both in natural and human-modified land-uses. Nevertheless, alien and native taxa showed different responses to environmental drivers: alien taxa were not affected by landscape variables, while the native ones were significantly influenced by all investigated environmental drivers and by the structural complexity of vegetation. SWOFs embedded in human-altered areas, in particularly in agricultural land-use, show good levels of naturalness: these results indicate that SWOFs represent an opportunity for natural conversion and rewilding of altered ecosystems. Small woodlands outside the forest can be the pillars to build and extend the green infrastructure network in both natural and modified land-uses, delivering important benefits for ecosystem services, and offering nature-based solutions to pamper fragmentation effects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'To counteract increasing water scarcity in the Mediterranean region, this study provides data on the efficiency of a decentralized, nature-based solution for hotel greywater (GW) treatment and reuse. A pilot plant of a constructed wetland called Vertical Ecosystem (vertECO), installed in a large hotel with GW separation, was operated continuously for 12 months. vertECO achieved a removal efficiency higher than 84.0% for COD and TSS and higher than 95.4% for turbidity and BOD5. The monitored physicochemical parameters in the effluent meet the requirements for many reuse purposes restricted in the water reuse legislation. Based on the pilot operation, an economic model was set to estimate its economic feasibility (CAPEX, OPEX and payback period of investment) at several treated volumes. The payback was calculated, at the water and energy prices of Spain and other countries, with a planned operation period of 20 years. The higher the water price, the lower was the payback period. Treated GW volumes of 10.5 and 20 m3/day correspond to payback periods for Spain of 10.1 years and 9.0 years, respectively. Finally, co-benefits of vertECO have been considered alongside economic terms, and compared with another intensive technology (i.e., membrane bioreactor). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Climate change (higher frequency and intensity of precipitation events) and land use change (urbanization reducing soil drainage capacity) are increasingly causing stormwater problems globally, especially in cities. Nature-based solutions such as urban greenspace rehabilitation programs are gaining considerable attention for restoring soil retention capacity and protecting cities against increasing flood risk. However, a better understanding of how effective such measures are in practice is needed to enable and promote their adoption across urban settings. To this end, in this study, we assess the effect of soil rehabilitation measures in terms of soil compaction, vegetation cover and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity by analysing the results of an infiltration measurement campaign conducted across a wide range of real-world greenspaces (from recently rehabilitated, to poorly maintained, down to highly degraded) in the Italian city of Milan, one of the most urbanized areas in Europe. Our results show that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity varies significantly across the examined greenspaces, due to differences in time from rehabilitation, soil compaction and vegetation cover. Specifically, we find that the highest unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is obtained after approximately 5 years since implementation of soil rehabilitation measures, which can be explained by the time needed (i) by the introduced vegetation to develop root systems, and (ii) by the soil matrix to develop a coherent structure that allows stable connections between pores and thus the strengthening of preferential water pathways. Finally, our study shows that, in absence of soil and vegetation maintenance, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity may decrease rapidly after about 9–12 years. These findings provide useful information for supporting the planning of nature-based solutions in practice, which will become increasingly important to protect our cities from climate change impacts and widespread urbanization going forwards. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " \"One of the key features of nature-based solutions (NBSs) is their high effectiveness and economic and resource efficiency in solving problems compared to traditional grey interventions. These aspects, however, have so far attracted little attention in the literature but should be considered, as the evaluation of NBS projects before implementation provides an opportunity to use them as practical tools. This paper aims to present a new evaluation framework of NBS projects (at the stage of solution selection) based on the application of performance questions and the indicators approach. The framework consists of three main stages: (1) the formulation of the project aim(s), including the problem(s) to be solved, the scales of the expected effects and the thresholds to be achieved; (2) the elimination of solutions that do not fit the local conditions and setting requirements; and (3) the examination of the performance questions. To consider the whole spectrum of influencing factors, a systematic review was performed to indicate the main concepts related to the issue of NBS effectiveness, including (1) stakeholders' participation, (2) policy and management capability, (3) economic efficiency, (4) analysis of synergies and trade-offs, (5) adaptation to local conditions, (6) adequate spatial scale and (7) performance in the long term. In the current study around 130 indicators were identified for the evaluation of NBS projects. Regarding the impact on the state of knowledge, the present work contributes to the discussion on the conceptual sphere of NBS and its practical implementation by introducing multi-perspective standards and guidelines for the selection of possible NBS projects, and it deals with the complexity of synergies and the trade-offs between benefits. © 2021 The Authors\",\n",

Seedling establishment is a key process governing lateral marsh expansion as seen in many coastal regions such as Europe and East Asia. Here, we evaluate mechanistically the response of seed bank dynamics to changing physical disturbance at tidal flats, using the globally common coastal foundation plant, cordgrass as a model. We conducted a large-scale field study in an estuary in Northwest Europe, where seed bank dynamics of cordgrass in the tidal flats was determined and linked to in situ hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. The results revealed that wave disturbance reduced the persistence of seeds on the surface, whereas amplified sediment disturbance lowered the persistence of both surface and buried seeds. Overall, this indicates that increasing storminess and associated sediment variability under climate change threatens seed bank persistence in tidal flats, and hence need urgently be incorporated into models for long-term bio-geomorphological development of vegetated coastal ecosystems. The knowledge gained here provides a basis for more accurate predictions on how climatically driven environmental changes may alter the fitness, resilience and persistence of coastal foundation plants, with significant implications for nature-based solutions with coastal vegetation to mitigate climate change effects. © Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Bouma, Zhu, Cai and Yang.',\n",
       " 'The climate resilience of river deltas is threatened by rising sea levels, accelerated land subsidence, and reduced sediment supply from contributing river basins. Yet, these uncertain and rapidly changing threats are rarely considered in conjunction. Here we provide an integrated assessment, on basin and delta scales, to identify key planning levers for increasing the climate resilience of the Mekong Delta. We find, first, that 23 to 90% of this unusually productive delta might fall below sea level by 2100, with the large uncertainty driven mainly by future management of groundwater pumping and associated land subsidence. Second, maintaining sediment supply from the basin is crucial under all scenarios for maintaining delta land and enhancing the climate resilience of the system. We then use a bottom-up approach to identify basin development scenarios that are compatible with maintaining sediment supply at current levels. This analysis highlights, third, that strategic placement of hydropower dams will be more important for maintaining sediment supply than either projected increases in sediment yields or improved sediment management at individual dams. Our results demonstrate 1) the need for integrated planning across basin and delta scales, 2) the role of river sediment management as a nature-based solution to increase delta resilience, and 3) global benefits from strategic basin management to maintain resilient deltas, especially under uncertain and changing conditions. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

       " 'Increasing human population, urbanisation, and climate change have resulted in the proliferation of hard coastal infrastructure such as seawalls and breakwaters. There is increasing impetus to create multifunctional coastal defence structures with the primary function of protecting people and property in addition to providing habitat for marine organisms through eco-engineering - a nature-based solutions approach. In this study, the independent and synergistic effects of physical complexity and seeding with native oysters in promoting diversity and abundances of sessile organisms were assessed at two locations on Penang Island, Malaysia. Concrete tiles with varying physical and biological complexity (flat, 2.5 cm ridges and crevices, and 5 cm ridges and crevices that were seeded or unseeded with oysters) were deployed and monitored over 12 months. The survival of the seeded oysters was not correlated with physical complexity. The addition of physical and biological complexity interacted to promote distinct community assemblages, but did not consistently increase the richness, diversity, or abundances of sessile organisms through time. These results indicate that complexity, whether physical or biological, is only one of many influences on biodiversity on coastal infrastructure. Eco-engineering interventions that have been reported to be effective in other regions may not work as effectively in others due to the highly dynamic conditions in coastal environment. Thus, it is important that other factors such as the local species pools, environmental setting (e.g., wave action), biological factors (e.g., predators), and anthropogenic stressors (e.g., pollution) should also be considered when designing habitat enhancements. Such factors acting individually or synergistically could potentially affect the outcomes of any planned eco-engineering interventions. © Copyright © 2021 Chee, Yee, Cheah, Evans, Firth, Hawkins and Strain.',\n",
       " 'Extreme drought events occur more frequently due to climate change. Soil water loss through evaporation is therefore significantly intensified. This study introduces an environment-friendly and sustainable bio-mediated technique, known as microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP), for water evaporation suppression in clayey soils. Through lab-scale evaporation tests, we investigate the effects of cementation solution concentration (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5\\xa0mol/L) and MICP treatment procedure (one-phase and two-phase MICP methods) on both macroscale (e.g., water loss, desiccation cracking) and microscale (e.g., microstructure variations) behaviors of soils. Experimental results show that MICP is capable of improving water retention capacity and enhancing the inter-particle bonding of clayey soils. Both water evaporation rate and total water loss decrease with the increasing concentration of cementation solution and the number of MICP treatment cycle. For most testing samples, both one-phase and two-phase MICP treatment methods have a similar influence on soil properties. Further microstructure characterizations reveal four key factors contributing to the improved soil response under drying, including dense surface crust, remediated desiccation cracks, smaller pore size and residual solutes. Dense structure of surface crust suppresses the migration of water vapor into the atmosphere. Calcite crystals tend to reduce the evaporation surface if precipitated within cracks, and clog the movement of pore water if precipitated within the soil pore space. This study is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of soil-atmosphere interactions under MICP treatment and provide insights into the potential application of bio-mediated technologies as a nature-based solution for drought mitigation in arid and semi-arid region. © 2021.

       " 'Urban planning is assumed to play an important role in developing nature-based solutions (NBS). To explore how NBS is addressed in urban development, municipal planning practices are analyzed based on three case studies in the Stockholm region of Sweden. Through focus group discussions, interviews and document studies, the planning and implementation of NBS and their intended contribution to regional green infrastructure (GI) and social and ecological qualities are investigated. The results show that the planning and design of urban green spaces engages the local community. Moreover, different conceptual frameworks are used to strengthen an ecological perspective and nurture expected outcomes, in particular ecosystem services and GI. Through competence development and collaborative approaches, the co-creation of innovative solutions for public and private green spaces is promoted. However, institutional conditions, e.g., legal frameworks and landownership shape the planning process and can challenge the ability to enhance social and ecological qualities. An assessment of the planning processes indicates a strong focus on ecosystem services and local GI, while the potential to contribute to regional GI differs widely between cases. The study concludes that a knowledge-driven and integrative planning process can foster the potential of NBS for green and sustainable cities. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The efficiency of nature-based facilities is mostly evaluated in terms of their pollutant removal capabilities; however, apart from water purification functions, constructed wetlands also per-form ecological, cultural, and environmental education functions. A multi-criteria performance index was developed in this study to evaluate the overall efficiency of constructed wetlands. A total of 54 constructed wetlands installed across South Korea were monitored to evaluate the pollutant removal performance of the facilities. A comparison between the conventional pollutant removal-based evaluation and the developed multi-criteria index was also performed to determine the key changes in the results of evaluation when different methods are employed. Among the different types of wetlands studied, hybrid systems were found to be the most effective in terms of pollutant removal due to their complex configurations and functions. Newly constructed treatment wetlands have unstable performance and thus, a stabilization period ranging from two to five years is required to assess the facility’s pollutant removal capabilities. As compared to the conventional pollutant removal-based efficiency evaluation, the comprehensive evaluation method provided a more strategic tool for identifying the facilities’ strengths and weaknesses. Generally, the multi-criteria performance index developed in this inquiry can be utilized as a general tool for evaluating the sustainability of similar nature-based facilities. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The increasing probability of loss and damage to floods is a global concern. Countries are united by an urgent need to reduce flood risk to households, businesses, agricultural land, and in-frastructure. As natural and engineered protection erodes with climate change and development pressures, new approaches to flood risk management delivered at the catchment scale that work with nature hold promise. One nature-based solution that aligns with this Special Issue on river flooding is the temporary storage of floodwaters on the floodplain. In many countries, this would involve controlled flooding inland low-lying agricultural land. Designing schemes that farmers and irrigation districts will adopt is essential. To inform future floodplain storage options, we review farm-centred drought management, specifically, agreements that transfer agricultural water to municipalities through fallowing in California, USA and an Australian farm exit scheme. These initiatives reveal underpinning principles around the need to: balance the multiple objectives of the parties, share the benefits and responsibilities, address local impacts and practical guidance on in-centive design including the consideration of conditional participation requirements and re-sponding to farmer and public preferences. In terms of funding there is opportunity for blended financing with flood-prone communities, insurers, and conservation charities. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognized as viable tools for sustainable urban water management. This article explores the implementation of NbS in two distinct cities, Singapore and Lisbon, to demonstrate that NbS can work in very different contexts and spark new thoughts on the urban–nature relationship and to identify commonalities that drive and enable the implementation of NbS in different context. Literature review-based research was conducted to examine the types of NbS implemented, the common drivers, the governance model, and the plural functionalities of the solutions. The research shows that, despite the differences, the two cities shared common drivers (including water supply, flood control, and resident demand for green space) and goals, such as improving water quality and overall quality of life, through the deployment of NbS. With rapid urban expansion, water use increase, and the impacts of climate change, NbS can be effective tools to deliver integrated benefits and improve the liveability of cities. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Low impact development practices (LID) as alternative measures of urban drainage can be used within the approach of resources recycling and co-management. This study evaluates the potential contribution of a bioretention system to flood control, non-potable water demands (NPD) and resources co-management. Bioretention setups were tested experimentally under variable conditions to identify operational key-factors to multiple purposes. Additionally, the efficiencies obtained for laboratory scale were extrapolated for household and watershed scale, quantifying the indicators of water demand reduction (WDR), energy demand reduction (EDR) and carbon emission reduction (CER) for hybrid systems with LID. The laboratory results indicated that the use of a bioretention with a submerged zone can improve the quality of the water recovered for reuse, while maintaining the efficiency of runoff retention and peak flow attenuation. Comparing the bioretention effluent quality with the Brazilian standards for stormwater reuse, the parameters color, turbidity, E. coli and metals were above the limits, indicating the necessity of a better treatment for solids particles and disinfection. Expanding the analysis to watershed scale, the bioretention helped to reduce NPD demands up to 45%, leading to a reduction in energy demand and carbon emission from the centralized water supply system. © 2021 The Authors',\n",

       " 'Integrated planning of urban blue–green infrastructures is crucial to strengthen urban environmental quality and mitigate negative climate change-associated effects. It implies, however, increased water demand for irrigation, wherefore greywater (wastewater excluding wastewater from toilets and urinals) can be used, yet it requires handling for safe reuse. One treatment option is the use of constructed wetlands (CW), which have thus far not been broadly applied in inner-city districts due to large area requirements. This work investigates a novel bipartite container-based vertical-flow constructed wetland (VFCW) for the treatment of light greywater (from showers and hand wash basins) and its use as irrigation water for urban facade greenery. The VFCW consists of two compartments with 2.5 m2 filter area each, filled with 75 cm zeolite-containing lava sand (0–4 mm) and 75 cm Rhine sand (0–2 mm), respectively. In short, screening has proven to be well suitable for coarse solids removal, so there is no further need to settle light greywater, which reduces overall treatment area and benefits urban application. Treated greywater complied with irrigation standards at all times, yet mixing with rainwater can help reduce salt contents, if applicable. The modular/elevated lava sand VFCW exhibited extensive nitrification, even at extremely low water temperatures, as well as mean effluent concentrations of 6.3 mg/L COD and &lt;0.05 mg/L Ptot, which makes it a very promising treatment option for greywater. All in all, the modular/elevated design promotes urban application of VFCW as a multifunctional blue–green system that can help increase urban resilience. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Riparian ecosystems in urban environments are usually degraded. Their sustainable management can reduce water pollution, mitigate climate change while providing recreation opportunities. This study assessed the current condition of the streams/torrents and their riparian areas in the city of Drama in Greece. In addition, practices to improve their functionality and enhance community awareness were recommended. A spatial database of the wider urban setting including suburbs and rural areas (weather, land cover, soils, roads, protected areas, riparian areas, etc.) was developed within GIS. The datasets were then inputted in a hydrologic model to simulate the water balance and stream discharge in the main urban streams and torrents. Field measurements of stream water discharge, and vegetation and stream channel conditions were undertaken using two visual protocols. The results of the protocols indicate that most streams/torrents and their riparian areas are of low ecological quality. Nature-based solutions were recommended to improve their ecological quality. In addition, the implementation of Eco-Routes was recommended to enhance the awareness of their importance and to promote their sustainable management. Overall, the urban streams/torrents and riparian ecosystems of Drama are degraded and innovative management practices should be implemented to conserve them and feature their ecosystem services. © 2021 The Authors Water Supply',\n",
       " 'Scholars of gender and climate change argue that gender-blind climate change actions could exacerbate existing inequalities and undermine sustained climate change adaptation actions. For this reason, since 2017, the Green Climate Fund placed gender among its key programming prerequisites, making it the first multilateral climate fund to do so worldwide. However, to date, no lessons to inform planned gender-responsive ecosystem-based interventions in Namibia have been drawn from community-based natural resource management. Thus, this paper aims to share key lessons regarding the way in which gender assessment is useful in enhancing equity in an eco-system-based adaptation programme for the Green Climate Fund. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews and group discussions in the 14 rural regions of Namibia with 151 participants from 107 community-based natural resource management organisations (73.5:26.5; male:female ra-tio). The results identified gender imbalances in leadership and decision-making due to intersecting historic inequalities, ethnicity and geography, as well as other socio-cultural factors in local com-munity-based natural resource management institutions. We also identified income disparities and unequal opportunities to diversify livelihoods, gendered differentiated impacts of climate change and meaningful participation in public forums. Overall, the assessment indicates that considering gender analysis at the initiation of a community-based climate change adaptation project is crucial for achieving resilience to climate change, closing the gender gap, building capacity to increase equity and empowering women in resource-dependent environments in Namibia and Sub-Saharan Africa more broadly. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'With climate change and rising sea levels, the coastal zone’s flood risk is deteriorating. Previous researches have shown a gradually degrading capacity of traditional hard engineering structures (e.g., seawall, dikes) on flood mitigation due to problems such as land subsidence and insufficient maintenance. To remedy the defects, the “building with nature concept” for coastal protection with saltmarshes was examined by combining field measurements and numerical simulations. The advantages of saltmarsh over traditional seawall on flood protection was demonstrated from the perspective of both flood area mitigation and economic gain, based on scenario simulations. Results show that tidal wetlands are essential in mitigating significant wave heights (Hs) and current velocities even during storm conditions. The storm wave and current velocity reduction ratio (RRw and RRc) by saltmarshes on Chongming Dongtan Shoal (CMDS) during Typhoon 9711 is approximately 11% and 51%, respectively. The wave and current mitigation by Scirpus mariqueter are more efficient than Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis during measurements in 2010, which were approximately 0.3 m and 0.2 m/s, 0.125 m and 0.155 m/s, 0.086 m and 0.128 m/s per kilometer width, respectively. The summer saltmarsh area 54.2 km2 on CMDS protects approximately 32 km2 land area behind the seawall from being flooded, equivalent to the seawall heightening of approximately 0.42 m on equivalent flood mitigation. The performance of cost-and-benefit analysis shows a relatively higher (by 3%–7%) net present value (NPV) and a higher (by 1.5 times) benefit-cost ratio (BC) of nature-based solution (i.e., saltmarsh restoration) compared with traditional hard engineering solution (i.e., seawall construction). Thus, building seawall with nature, such as a hybrid flood protection measure, should be implemented in the future coastal redesign and maintenance. © 2021, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'Urban lakes play a major role in the socio-cultural and ecological sustainability of many cities, but are often under major development and pollution pressures. Urban decision makers are faced with a challenging task of identifying the causes of their decline and building plans for their conservation or rejuvenation. Powai Lake is a perfect example of an urban water body with historic, cultural, and ecological importance to the population of Metropolitan Mumbai, with local and regional authorities, including the Urban Development Department, Government of Maharashtra, working to identify methods for rejuvenating the Lake. In this context, characterization of pollution dynamics, hotspots, and extent is fundamental to the development of management plans and appropriate technologies for the remediation and rejuvenation of Powai Lake—the long-term goal of the present study. A two-year monitoring program at eight sampling locations on the Lake’s periphery, with the engagement of citizen scientists along with environmental researchers, revealed clear seasonal and spatial dynamics that allowed for the identification of pollution drivers and the development of a three-phase rejuvenation plan. The plan represents a novel and holistic approach that recognizes Powai Lake as a complex system with multiple drivers, and aims at ecological balance and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Sustainable development demands reliable water resources, yet traditional water management has broadly failed to avoid environmental degradation and contain infrastructure costs. We explore the global-scale feasibility of combining natural capital with engineering-based (green-gray) approaches to meet water security threats over the 21st century. Threats to water resource systems are projected to rise throughout this period, together with a significant expansion in engineering deployments and progressive loss of natural capital. In many parts of the world, strong path dependencies are projected to arise from the legacy of prior environmental degradation that constrains future water management to a heavy reliance on engineering-based approaches. Elsewhere, retaining existing stocks of natural capital creates opportunities to employ blended green-gray water infrastructure. By 2050, annual engineering expenditures are projected to triple to $2.3 trillion, invested mainly in developing economies. In contrast, preserving natural capital for threat suppression represents a potential $3.0 trillion in avoided replacement costs by mid-century. Society pays a premium whenever these nature-based assets are lost, as the engineering costs necessary to achieve an equivalent level of threat management are, on average, twice as expensive. Countries projected to rapidly expand their engineering investments while losing natural capital will be most constrained in realizing green-gray water management. The situation is expected to be most restrictive across the developing world, where the economic, technical, and governance capacities to overcome such challenges remain limited. Our results demonstrate that policies that support blended green-gray approaches offer a pathway to future global water security but will require a strategic commitment to preserving natural capital. Absent such stewardship, the costs of water resource infrastructure and services will likely rise substantially and frustrate efforts to attain universal and sustainable water security. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Rapid urbanization, aging infrastructure, and changes in rainfall patterns linked to climate change have brought considerable challenges to water managers around the world. Impacts from such drivers are likely to increase even further unless the appropriate actions are put in place. Floods, landslides, droughts and water pollution are just a few examples of such impacts and their corresponding consequences are in many cases devastating. At the same time, it has become a well-accepted fact that traditional (i.e., grey infrastructure) measures are no longer effective in respond-ing to such challenges. Nature-based solutions (NBS) have emerged as a new response towards hy-dro-meteorological risk reduction and the results obtained to date are encouraging. However, their application has been mainly in the area of water quantity management with few studies that report on their efficiency to deal with water quality aspects. These solutions are based on replicating natural phenomena and processes to solve such problems. The present paper addresses the question of three NBS systems, namely, bio-retention cells, vegetative swales and porous pavements, for the removal of total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) when applied in different configurations (single or networked). The results presented in this paper aim to advance the understanding of their performances during varying rainfall patterns and configurations and their potential application conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, the new framework provides the following: (1) a comprehensive set of Urban Circularity Challenges (UCCs); (2) a set of more than fifty NBS units and NBS interventions thoroughly assessed in terms of their potential to address UCCs; and (3) an analysis of input and output resource streams, which are both required for and produced during operation of NBS.

       " 'A framework developed by the COST Action Circular City (an EU-funded network of 500+ scientists from 40+ countries; COST = Cooperation in Science and Technology) for addressing Urban Circularity Challenges (UCCs) with nature-based solutions (NBSs) was analyzed by various urban sectors which refer to different fields of activities for circular management of resources in cities (i.e., reducing use of resources and production of waste). The urban sectors comprise the built environment, urban water management, resource recovery, and urban farming. We present main findings from sector analyses, discuss different sector perspectives, and show ways to overcome these differences. The results reveal the potential of NBSs to address multiple sectors, as well as multiple UCCs. While water has been identified as a key element when using NBSs in the urban environment, most NBSs are interconnected and also present secondary benefits for other resources. Using representative examples, we discuss how a holistic and systemic approach could facilitate the circular use of resources in cities. Currently, there is often a disciplinary focus on one resource when applying NBSs. The full potential of NBSs to address multifunctionality is, thus, usually not fully accounted for. On the basis of our results, we conclude that experts from various disciplines can engage in a cross-sectoral exchange and identify the full potential of NBSs to recover resources in circular cities and provide secondary benefits to improve the livelihood for locals. This is an important first step toward the full multifunctionality potential enabling of NBSs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Urban agriculture (UA) plays a key role in the circular metabolism of cities, as it can use water resources, nutrients, and other materials recovered from streams that currently leave the city as solid waste or as wastewater to produce new food and biomass. The ecosystem services of urban green spaces and infrastructures and the productivity of specific urban agricultural technologies have been discussed in literature. However, the understanding of input and output (I/O) streams of different nature-based solutions (NBS) is not yet sufficient to identify the challenges and opportunities they offer for strengthening circularity in UA. We propose a series of agriculture NBS, which, implemented in cities, would address circularity challenges in different urban spaces. To identify the challenges, gaps, and opportunities related to the enhancement of resources management of agriculture NBS, we evaluated NBS units, interventions, and supporting units, and analyzed I/O streams as links of urban circularity. A broader understanding of the food-related urban streams is important to recover resources and adapt the distribution system accordingly. As a result, we pinpointed the gaps that hinder the development of UA as a potential opportunity within the framework of the Circular City. © 2021 by the authors.

In this research, we consider the application of NBS as a catalyst for social inclusivity in urban regeneration strategies, enabled through civic participation in the co-creation of green interventions with respect to social cohesion and wellbeing. This article is focused on a social monitoring framework elaborated within the H2020 CLEVER Cities project, with the city of Milan as a case study. Firstly, we overviewed the major regeneration challenges and expected co-benefits of the project, which are mainly human health and wellbeing, social cohesion and environmental justice, as well as citizen perception about safety and security related to the NBS implementation process. Secondly, we examined the relevance of using NBS in addressing social co-benefits by analyzing data from questionnaires against a set of five major indicators, submitted to citizens and participants of activities during pre-greening interventions: (1) Place, use of space and relationship with nature, (2) Perceived ownership and sense of belonging, (3) Psychosocial issues, social interactions and social cohesion, (4) Citizen perception about safety and security, and lastly, we analyzed (5) knowledge about CLEVER interventions and NBS benefits in relation to socio-demographics of the questionnaires’ respondents. Thirdly, we cross-referenced a wind-rose multi-model of co-benefits analysis for NBS across the regeneration challenges of the project. Because of the COVID-19 emer-gency, in this research we mainly focused on site observations and online questionnaires, as well as on monitoring pre-greening scenarios in three Urban Living Labs (ULLs) in Milan, namely CLEVER Action Labs. Lastly, this study emphasizes the expected social added values of NBS impact over long-term urban regeneration projects. Insights from the pre-greening surveys results accentuate the importance of the NBS interventions in citizens’ perceptions about their wellbeing, general health and strong sense of neighborhood belonging. A wider interest towards civic participation in co-management and getting informed about NBS interventions in the Milanese context is also noted. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Urban areas worldwide must manage stormwater to prevent flooding and reduce pollution. Infrastructure has historically been designed and used for the single purpose of managing stormwater, but this gray infrastructure typically has negative consequences and fails to address other challenges faced by urban areas. As an alternative, vegetated Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) such as bioretention facilities, constructed stormwater wetlands, and outfall retrofits may be used to capture and treat stormwater, while also contributing other benefits, such as reducing urban heat-island effects, increasing carbon sequestration, improving air quality, climate adaptation, and access to open space, and enhancing mental and physical health and urban biodiversity. To optimize these benefits, the siting of NBS can be crucial. We developed a spatially explicit analytical methodology, Planting Stormwater Solutions, to prioritize the siting of vegetated NBS to benefit biological diversity, social and public health, and water quality. Using Los Angeles as a case study, we demonstrate where benefits spatially converge or diverge. We found that while some of the greatest opportunities to benefit biodiversity occur along waterways, the greatest social and public health benefits may be realized for NBS installed in and around heavily developed areas. NBS sited in areas with a high density of commercial and industrial land uses may provide the greatest water quality benefits. Use of our analytical methodology may allow decision-makers with limited resources and multiple challenges to make more informed siting decisions for vegetated NBS. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " \"Vegetative barriers are increasingly used to reduce sediment export from cropland and thus mitigate negative off-site consequences of soil erosion. Here, we report and discuss the effectiveness of vegetative barriers implemented in Flanders (Belgium) to buffer the flows of water and sediment. The three types of vegetative barriers studied are made of straw bales, wood chips or bales of coconut- fibre. Based on three simulated runoff experiments performed in the field, we calculated the hydraulic roughness and sediment deposition ratio. Our experiments showed that the barriers made of coconut-fibre bales performed markedly better than those of straw bales or wood chips (Manning's n values of 1.355, 1.049 and 2.231 s m-1/3 and a sediment deposition ratio of 19%, 38% and 64% for barriers made of straw bales, wood chips and coconut-fibre bales, respectively, during the first experiment). These values increased during subsequent experiments demonstrating the effect of sediment accumulating inside the structures. Especially for coconut-fibre bales, this accumulation increases the risk of runoff bypassing or overtopping the barriers. The barriers mainly retained sand and, to a lesser extent, silt and clay. As vegetative barriers have to be renewed every few years because of the decomposition of organic material, barriers made of locally available materials are more sustainable as a nature-based solution to erosion. We conclude that although the vegetative barriers made of coconut-fibre bales are superior in their regulation of flows of runoff and sediment, barriers made of locally sourced materials are more sustainable. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\",\n",
       " 'Livability, resilience, and justice in cities are challenged by climate change and the historical legacies that together create disproportionate impacts on human communities. Urban green infrastructure has emerged as an important tool for climate change adaptation and resilience given their capacity to provide ecosystem services such as local temperature regulation, stormwater mitigation, and air purification. However, realizing the benefits of ecosystem services for climate adaptation depend on where they are locally supplied. Few studies have examined the potential spatial mismatches in supply and demand of urban ecosystem services, and even fewer have examined supply–demand mismatches as a potential environmental justice issue, such as when supply–demand mismatches disproportionately overlap with certain socio-demographic groups. We spatially analyzed demand for ecosystem services relevant for climate change adaptation and combined results with recent analysis of the supply of ecosystem services in New York City (NYC). By quantifying the relative mismatch between supply and demand of ecosystem services across the city we were able to identify spatial hot- and coldspots of supply–demand mismatch. Hotspots are spatial clusters of census blocks with a higher mismatch and coldspots are clusters with lower mismatch values than their surrounding blocks. The distribution of mismatch hot- and coldspots was then compared to the spatial distribution of socio-demographic groups. Results reveal distributional environmental injustice of access to the climate-regulating benefits of ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure in NYC. Analyses show that areas with lower supply–demand mismatch tend to be populated by a larger proportion of white residents with higher median incomes, and areas with high mismatch values have lower incomes and a higher proportion of people of color. We suggest that urban policy and planning should ensure that investments in “nature-based” solutions such as through urban green infrastructure for climate change adaptation do not reinforce or exacerbate potentially existing environmental injustices. © 2021 The Authors.

       " \"As cities increasingly turn to nature-based solutions to address key urban socio-ecological challenges, approaches to their governance, planning and implementation are increasingly important for ensuring their effectiveness. Nature-based solutions are multifunctional, and so their planning and implementation are by necessity interdisciplinary. As such, to support urban transitions with nature-based solutions, the role of intermediary actors deserves research attention. Intermediaries play key roles in linking between sectors, across different levels of government and between disciplines and policy domains. We identified three key points for research and planning nature-based solutions through intermediaries as key agents for change: intermediaries are creators of enabling institutional spaces needed for mainstreaming nature-based solutions in cities; intermediaries as actor configurations are dynamic over time and in context, and intermediation has to be understood as a fundamental governance activity in cities that want to scale up their climate adaptation planning with nature-based solutions. Using a case study of the development and initial implementation of the metropolitan urban forest strategy in Melbourne Australia, we analyze the multi-actor landscape that emerged, through the lens of intermediation. We systematically investigated which actors, partnerships and platforms acted as intermediaries in the transformative agenda of the Urban Forest strategy, how these actors interacted over the course of the strategy's development and how their roles and functions shifted during the early implementation stages of the strategy. We found that an ‘ecology of intermediaries’ adopted a range of roles to support key functions including building collaboration, informing and disseminating policy learning, and strengthening political support. While intermediaries’ roles and functions shifted across the strategy's development, their contributions were critical in the complex metropolitan governance context. Collaborative planning and governance for nature-based solutions in cities require intermediaries to remain topical, focused and inclusive/open to new ideas and lessons from innovations both emerging and driven. © 2021\",\n",
       " \"Urban and peri-urban forests provide multiple ecosystem services for city dwellers, including water, opportunities for recreation and tourism, climate regulation and habitat provision. Despite growing scholarly attention to urban forests, few studies to date have conducted comprehensive assessments of their ecosystem services. This study conducts an interdisciplinary and wide-ranging assessment of ecosystem services of Oslomarka, the emblematic forest surrounding Oslo, Norway's capital city. First, we set the historical background and examine drivers of change shaping forest uses and ecosystem service composition at the study area. Second, we identify, characterize and measure ecosystem services delivered at the study area. Third, we assess trends in these ecosystem services over the past 50 years. Three main findings are highlighted. First, institutional, technological, and cultural factors are the main drivers of change shaping current ecosystem service composition. Second, ten ecosystem services and three sub-services were assessed and characterized, with water and opportunities for recreation and tourism found to be of particular prominence to locals. Third, our results show that provisioning and habitat services have declined over the past fifty years, while carbon sequestration and storage has increased. Cultural services increased overall, while also experiencing major changes in their nature and composition. Our research reveals the fundamental importance of Oslo's urban forests and its ecosystem services for the well-being of local inhabitants. © 2021 The Authors\",\n",
       " \"Ecosystem restoration and, in particular, peatland restoration, are considered a promising greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategy to move towards net zero emissions. To remain within acceptable limits for projected warming scenarios, inaction with respect to GHG mitigation in the short term implies a need for even larger removals of GHGs in the longer term, which can be conceptualized as a ‘mitigation debt’. This paper explores the economic implications of delaying GHG mitigation through ecosystem restoration using data of a large survey (N = 1377) that included a choice experiment to elicit the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for peatland restoration in Scotland, UK. The valuation specifically considers the interaction between the timing of restoration action and long-term ecosystem resilience. We find that respondents have a substantial WTP for peatland restoration. Importantly, we find considerable benefits for early restoration action (up to £191 million annually in our case study), which is linked to an increased resilience of peatlands under future climate change. This demonstrates that delaying restoration and thus accumulating a mitigation debt has an important opportunity cost that substantially decreases the related economic benefits. Attitudes towards climate change and climate change beliefs are found to explain variation in the public's WTP. Our research strengthens the economic argument for not delaying climate change mitigation through ecosystem restoration, demonstrating that the mitigation debt also translates into a welfare loss. To fully realise the potential benefits associated with immediate mitigation using peatland restoration, however, more needs to be understood about the mechanisms that facilitate large-scale implementation in practice. © 2021 The Author(s)\",\n",
       " 'Quantitative investigation of wave attenuation by flexible vegetation is an increasingly prominent area in wave mechanics. Given that the existing XBeach non-hydrostatic wave model can only simulate wave attenuation by rigid vegetation, a mechanical model for simulating submerged flexible vegetation dynamics driven by waves and a coupling simulation method between the flexible vegetation dynamic model and the XBeach non-hydrostatic wave model were proposed. To assess the performance of the proposed coupled model, a wave flume experiment was conducted. This study demonstrates the validity of the new flexible vegetation dynamic model in simulating forces and motions of a single submerged flexible stem. The validation between modeled results and experimental data shown that the coupled model is capable of reproducing the wave attenuation in the presence of flexible vegetation. The above results further indicate that the coupling implementation is valid and reliable. Besides, this study further confirms that flexible vegetation is able to attenuate wave height, and the elasticity modulus of flexible vegetation plays a vital role in wave attenuation when all the other variables are invariant. This study can broaden the application of the XBeach model and provide technical support for the engineering practice of coastal nature-based solutions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have rapidly been gaining traction across the research, policy and practice spheres, advocated as transformative actions to jointly address biodiversity loss and climate change. However, there are multiple, alternative ways to conceptualize NbS across those three spheres. To inform the NbS discourses in research, policy and practice, we critically reflect on the prevailing framing of NbS. Although the concept links environmental health to human well-being, we argue that its current dominant framing reinforces a dichotomy between people and nature by highlighting one, external nature working for the benefit of society. For the NbS concept to support transformation, we believe it must embody a reframing of human–nature relationships towards regenerative relationships between humans and nature. To support the transformative aspirations of NbS, we propose a novel core framing of NbS making explicit the co-dependence of people and nature, which underpins human well-being and environmental health. We highlight how such a framing can support a transformation through influencing beliefs and normative values, and second, through the communication and application of the NbS concept in research, policy and practice. We then elaborate on how such a framing is key to support inclusivity and collaboration between diverse research perspectives, policy objectives across scales and implementation practices to deliver just and successful NbS.

       " \"Although mangroves reduce the daily risk of flood for millions of people, it is still difficult to estimate the protection they provide for variable wave conditions and forest characteristics. This aspect is crucial for the promotion of conservation and restoration of mangrove forests and for the estimation of how the coastal protection service they provide will evolve over time. This paper presents evidence and a new method for the estimation of the relationship between mangrove forest age and wave attenuation. The forest under analysis is characterised by the age of the Rhizophora mangrove trees, where consideration is given to the differences in the maturity of its individual trees and the density of the forest. Environmental conditions are defined by water levels and incoming wave height and period. A set of empirical and analytical relations expressing wave attenuation as a function of the submerged solid volume fraction (SVF) are presented. Changes is tree morphology and forest characteristics with forest age, as well as the contribution of the tree canopy, are taken into account. Results indicate that, after restoration, it may take only 5 years to obtain a forest's maximum coastal protection capacity. Additionally, such capacity appears to be maintained throughout the forest's lifetime with minor variations, provided the forest is not affected by any conditions altering its health, such as extreme wave events or anthropogenic action that may modify its habitat. Our findings present a new approach to quantifying the protection provided by mangroves without requiring any calibration. These findings can also assist in planning mangrove restoration and assessing associated benefits by providing the incorporation of nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based adaptation into coastal management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'In policy and practice, urban Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are considered promising innovations for sustainable urban transformation. NBS are interventions that use nature to address multiple sustainability challenges simultaneously. As such, they present a novel perspective on urban land use and development. Yet their current uptake into urban development lags behind EU ambitions. Drawing from transitions studies, this paper suggests that the limited uptake of NBS innovation stems from structural conditions that keep urban development systems locked in their current state, thereby favouring traditional ‘grey’ development. With a systematic literature review, we identify preliminary structural conditions that likely affect the uptake of urban NBS, culminating in a framework of ‘urban infrastructure regimes’, which we then illustrate with two European examples of urban NBS. Our findings indicate the relevance of using a transitions studies perspective for generating insights into the structural conditions – knowledge base, policy paradigms, etc. – that underlie barriers and opportunities for NBS uptake. We particularly argue that identifying the state and obduracy of these conditions provides a deeper understanding of how NBS uptake takes place. Findings also suggest that nature-based innovations require a customised transitions framework that accounts for the role of physical geographies. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'The benefits of urban green and blue infrastructure (UGI) are widely discussed, but rarely take into account local conditions or contexts. Although assessments increasingly consider the demand for the ecosystem services that UGI provides, they tend to only map the spatial pattern of pressures such as heat, or air pollution, and lack a wider understanding of where the beneficiaries are located and who will benefit most. We assess UGI in five cities from four continents with contrasting climate, socio-political context, and size. For three example services (air pollution removal, heat mitigation, accessible greenspace), we run an assessment that takes into account spatial patterns in the socio-economic demand for ecosystem services and develops metrics that reflect local context, drawing on the principles of vulnerability assessment. Despite similar overall levels of UGI (from 35 to 50% of urban footprint), the amount of service provided differs substantially between cities. Aggregate cooling ranged from 0.44 °C (Leicester) to 0.98 °C (Medellin), while pollution removal ranged from 488 kg PM2.5/yr (Zomba) to 48,400 kg PM2.5/yr (Dhaka). Percentage population with access to nearby greenspace ranged from 82% (Dhaka) to 100% (Zomba). The spatial patterns of pressure, of ecosystem service, and of maximum benefit within a city do not necessarily match, and this has implications for planning optimum locations for UGI in cities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'In recent decades, a change of paradigm in flood risk management (FRM) has been taking place worldwide. The most current legislation and policies reflect this. This change of paradigm implies a gradual transition towards the adoption of more proactive, integrating strategies which require investment in nature-based solutions (NbS) to mitigate flood risk while ensuring the good status of water bodies and restoring river-floodplain systems. To be effective, this transition should be accompanied by an evolution in governance: from top-down approaches to bottom-up schemes in which empowered and well-endowed stakeholder engagement becomes essential. However, the still limited experiences in implementing this combination present numerous potential difficulties and barriers. We use empirical techniques of social network analysis in combination with latent class cluster analysis to diagnose ex-ante these potential challenges to guide policy makers in designing suitable strategies of communication and involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process. The analysis is carried out in two stages: (i) identifying and examining the relationships of key stakeholders involved in the management, conservation and exploitation of fluvial systems; and (ii) categorising stakeholders according to their perception of the effectiveness of NbS. Only by creating a cohesive and power-balanced river network is it possible to implement just and legitimate FRM strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Addressing urban challenges with nature-based approaches can improve and protect ecosystem services. Yet, urban planning has not efficiently integrated such approaches to manage land use. This paper examines interactions between human and natural systems that result in ecosystem services and changes in land use and land cover in urban areas. It develops a social-ecological model for land use and land cover change, and for ecosystems services that integrates nature-based solutions in urban planning. The model treats spatial variations in ecosystems services as both drivers and consequences of human decision-making in choosing commercial and residential locations that drive land use and land cover change. We tested the social-ecological model in Stockholm County, Sweden, on a 30 × 30 m grid. Results show that accessibility in ecosystem services drives urban residential and commercial development, characterized by non-linearity. Areas around existing urban centers show high accessibility in ecosystem services and high development probabilities, whereas smaller population centers in large areas enjoy high accessibility to ecosystem services and low urban development probabilities. Model results suggest place-specific nature-based strategies for addressing the heterogeneous spatial relationships between ecosystem services and urban development. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'The 2017 Atlantic storm season caused widespread damage to Caribbean nations including the British Virgin Islands. The winds and rainfall associated with Hurricanes Irma, Maria and Jose all played their part in the destruction of infrastructure, livelihoods and the environment. With an increased interest in nature-based solutions to reduce flood risk, increasing the resilience of coastal communities and a focus on three of the most vulnerable communities in the Virgin Islands, we report on the use of flood risk vulnerability models based on remotely sensed satellite data and ecosystem services principles. Models were created with 4 primary aims to: (1) monitor the impact of storms and the recovery of mangroves, (2) assess the risk of flooding due to hurricane storm surges and extra-tropical storms (ground seas), (3) model opportunity areas for the restoration of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus) and (4) model and produce maps highlighting the predicted benefits that mangrove restoration will have on vulnerable coastal communities. Results highlight that between 75 and 94% of red mangroves in the three communities were negatively impacted by hurricanes in 2017. However, vulnerability models predict that even small-scale mangrove restoration initiatives can help to reduce the flood risk of homes and infrastructure up to 475 m inland. This work has provided the rationale for mangrove restoration in the Virgin Islands and presents an important tool for expansion across the wider Caribbean region that can be used to inform coastal restoration and resiliency building activities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"It has already been proven that trees and shrubs, can efficiently remove particulate matter (PM) from air. However, almost nothing is known about PM accumulation by herbaceous plants (grasses and forbs) found in urban meadows. Meadows, unlike trees and shrubs, can be located close to roads, one of the main sources of PM in cites. The aim of this study was to investigate the tolerance to urban condition and PM accumulation in the immediate roads vicinity of selected plants species in urban meadows. PM accumulation of annual and perennial meadows was compared with that of lawns. Results were interpreted in the context of species composition, biomass production, soil conditions and ambient PM concentrations. Of the species grown in annual meadows, the highest PM accumulation was found in Achillea millefolium L., Chenopodium album L. and Echium vulgare L., while Centaurea scabiosa L., Echium vulgare L. and Convolvulus arvensis L. accumulated the largest amounts of PM in perennial meadows. PM deposition on plants was positively correlated with a feathery leaf shape. For species in the annual meadows, a positive correlation was also found between PM accumulation and the wax content on plants. The presence of hairs on leaves, leaf size and plant growth pattern had no effect on PM deposition on plants. PM accumulation in one square metre of urban meadow was on average greater than that of lawn, regardless of meadow species' composition, age and location. The greatest accumulation of PM was found in a perennial meadow with low biodiversity but the greatest biomass. It would appear that the biomass produced by meadows and canopy structure has a crucial impact on the amount of PM accumulated by meadow plants. The results obtained indicate that meadows could be an important element of nature-based solutions for mitigating air pollution in urbanised areas. © 2021 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'In recent years, the occurrence of floods is one of the most important challenges facing in Hamadan city. In the absence/inefficiency of urban drainage systems, rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems as low-impact development (LID) methods can be considered as a measure to reduce the floods. In this study, three scenarios concerning the RWH from the roof surfaces are studied to evaluate the type of the harvested water on reducing flooding. In the first scenario, which indicates the current situation in the studied area, it is indicated that there is no harvest of the roof surfaces in the studied area. The second scenario is about the use of water harvested from the roof surfaces for household purposes. The third scenario also refers to the use of harvested water for irrigation of gardens. The simulation results of these three scenarios using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) method in the Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model reveal that if the second scenario is implemented, the runoff volume decreases from 28 to 12% for the return period from 2 to 100 years. However, in the third scenario, this reduction in runoff volume will be 48 and 27% for return periods of 2 to 100 years, respectively. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that the use of harvested water can also affect the reduction on runoff volume. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'In human-impacted coastal ecosystems, living shorelines are becoming a common restoration technique. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the ecological and physical benefits, and how they could inform management needs. To address this, we studied effectiveness of living shorelines at a broad spatial scale within the Washington State boundaries of the Salish Sea, USA, with restored site ages spanning 1–11 years. We surveyed 30 beaches at ten locations, each with three strata of: (1) living shoreline beaches with armor removed, (2) armored control beaches altered by seawalls or riprap, and (3) un-armored reference beaches with natural conditions. We sampled eight physical and biological attributes: beach wrack, wrack invertebrates, sediments, terrestrial insects, riparian vegetation, logs, beach profiles, and stable isotope signatures of talitrid amphipods – generating 27 metrics focusing on upper intertidal and supratidal elevations affected by armoring and targeted by living shoreline actions. These metrics spanned the functions of beach stability, ecological diversity, and food web support for juvenile salmon. Statistical tests showed that 19 of the 27 metrics had significant strata differences, indicating that some beach metrics restore quickly (e.g., wrack accumulation), while others take longer (e.g., log accumulation). Terrestrial-associated metrics were higher at reference beaches, but insect taxa richness and logs with plant growth increased at beaches restored for four or more years (the average age of the living shoreline sites). This implies that certain living shoreline functions increase through time, providing improved food web support. Globally, trajectories of restoration have shown a range of functional improvement with time, and will be important to monitor for nature-based solutions to coastal defense given the increasing rate of shoreline stressors from global change and sea level rise. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'In this perspective, we present how three initial landmark papers on urban sustainability research contributed to the larger sustainability science scholarship and paved the way for the continued development of urban sustainability research. Based on this, we propose three conceptual innovation pathways to trace the progression of urban sustainability science: First, urban sustainability from a system’s perspective, meaning that urban sustainability requires integrative solutions to work in the tripled social-ecological-technological system setting. Second, urban sustainability from a (people and place) relational perspective, meaning urban sustainability is a contested and dynamic social-ecological contract of cities. As a governance mission, urban sustainability requires evidence from research that can inform coordinated action to bridge people, places, meanings, visions and ecosystems. Third, urban sustainability from a transformative science perspective, meaning that for urban sustainability to be achieved and progressed, deep transformations are required in systems, relations, policies and governance approaches. Our proposal for the future of urban sustainability science centres on emphasizing the relevance and policy applicability of systems’ thinking, value and place thinking and transitions/transformations thinking as fundamental to how knowledge is co-produced by research science, policy and society and becomes actionable. © 2021, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.',\n",
       " 'Aim: This article aims to make clearer, with supporting evidence, the clinical benefits of the nature-based rehabilitation program (NBRP) and the restorative values of visiting botanical garden for people with stress-related mental disorders. Background: Throughout the years, nature-based therapy has been acknowledged as a valuable rehabilitation practice that integrates specially designed natural environments and nature-related activities for people with mental health conditions. Subject and Methods: The comparative analyses of parallel conducted the NBRP at botanical garden and occupational therapy realised at the Day Hospital of the Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade included 27 participants divided into two groups. The data collection employed a mixed method combining a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale and on-site observations. Results: The positive findings on the psychological recovery of the participants seem to be related to NBRP. The restorative potential of the garden was recognized through the observed interaction between participants and the natural entities employed through the various themed activities. The observed landscape elements especially solitary plant specimens or tall and single-form trees within the garden can be embraced as design guidelines for the development of an evidence-based practice that can support the recovery process of people with mental health conditions. Conclusion: Our findings endorse that ongoing social development and progressive urbanization have broadened the interest in scientific research involving nature-based solutions that help preserve the physical and mental health of people in low- and middle-income Western Balkan countries with a high prevalence of mental disorders in the urban environment that relates to social inequalities and natural disasters. © The Author(s) 2021.',\n",
       " 'The continued influx of refugees into Uganda confronts people and hosting landscapes with severe challenges. Vast volumes of biomass resources are required for energy and building materials. Consequently, woodlands have come under pressure as the key source within refugee-receiving regions. This raises the question of how to simultaneously achieve a higher standard of living and energy autonomy for the population while reducing primary resource demand and safeguarding nature. We propose that nature-based and/or technological adaptions can ameliorate this dramatic and deteriorating situation. We thus evaluated the impact of: (i) building autonomy by growing biomass resources on scale via approaches such as agroforestry and ii) enhancing energy efficiency through use of improved cook stoves (ICS) and switching toward renewable energy sources. Focusing on four Ugandan districts, we analyzed the energy and land demand of households and districts in three scenarios. Our results show all districts running into shortages of biomass resources and cultivable land and two districts already reaching their limits. An efficient use of woodfuel combined with solar energy could reduce primary energy demand by up to 37%. The remaining wood demand could be realized by agroforestry systems thereby ensuring household energy autonomy and access to reliable energy sources. We recommend combining energy efficiency measures and technology to reduce firewood demand with agroforestry solutions to satisfy the remaining necessities. Both are needed to reduce the essistential pressure on woodlands and increase the energy autonomy of refugee-hosting landscapes while respecting stakeholder needs. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " \"Seagrasses have the ability to contribute towards climate change mitigation, through large organic carbon (Corg) sinks within their ecosystems. Although the importance of blue carbon within these ecosystems has been addressed in some countries of Southeast Asia, the regional and national inventories with the application of nature-based solutions are lacking. In this study, we aim to estimate national coastal blue carbon stocks in the seagrass ecosystems in the countries of Southeast Asia including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. This study further assesses the potential of conservation and restoration practices and highlights the seagrass meadows as nature-based solution for climate change mitigation. The average value of the total carbon storage within seagrass meadows of this region is 121.95 ± 76.11 Mg ha−1 (average ± SD) and the total Corg stock of the seagrass meadows of this region was 429.11 ± 111.88 Tg, with the highest Corg stock in the Philippines (78%). The seagrass meadows of this region have the capacity to accumulate 5.85–6.80 Tg C year−1, which accounts for $214.6–249.4 million USD. Under the current rate of decline of 2.82%, the seagrass meadows are emitting 1.65–2.08 Tg of CO2 year−1 and the economic value of these losses accounts for $21.42–24.96 million USD. The potential of the seagrass meadows to the offset current CO2 emissions varies across the region, with the highest contribution to offset is in the seagrass meadows of the Philippines (11.71%). Current national policies and commitments of nationally determined contributions do not include blue carbon ecosystems as climate mitigation measures, even though these ecosystems can contribute up to 7.03% of the countries' reduction goal of CO2 emissions by 2030.

       " 'Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have been advocated to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. The uptake of NbS differs regionally with some countries exhibiting greater uptake than others. The success of NbS also differs regionally with varying environmental conditions and social-ecological processes. In many regions, the body of knowledge, particularly around the efficacy of such efforts, remains fragmented. Having an “inventory” or “tool box” of regionally-trialed methods, outcomes and lessons learnt can improve the evidence base, inform adaptive management, and ultimately support the uptake of NbS. Using Malaysia as a case study, we provide a comprehensive overview of trialed and tested NbS efforts that used nature to address societal challenges in marine and coastal environments (here referring to mangroves, seagrass, coral reefs), and detailed these efforts according to their objectives, as well as their anticipated and actual outcomes. The NbS efforts were categorized according to the IUCN NbS approach typology and mapped to provide a spatial overview of IUCN NbS effort types. A total of 229 NbS efforts were collated, representing various levels of implementation success. From the assessment of these efforts, several key actions were identified as a way forward to enhance the uptake of Nature-based Solutions for informing coastal sustainable development policy and planning. These include increasing education, training, and knowledge sharing; rationalizing cooperation across jurisdictions, laws, and regulations; enhancing environmental monitoring; leveraging on existing policies; enabling collaboration and communication; and implementing sustainable finance instruments. These findings can be used to inform the improved application and uptake of NbS, globally. © Copyright © 2021 Chee, Firth, Then, Yee, Mujahid, Affendi, Amir, Lau, Ooi, Quek, Tan, Yap, Yeap and McQuatters-Gollop.',\n",
       " 'Climate change is affecting water quantity and quality, with severe impacts on agricultural production. The use of nature-based solutions to address these challenges is increasing. Natural water retention ponds have been identified as viable solutions for water management in agriculture. This paper aims to characterize water retention ponds, and to quantify their effectiveness, direct and indirect benefits, and costs. The paper analyses the case of the Lamone river catchment in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), characterized by large seasonal variability of water flow and availability. This is an important agricultural area that relies heavily on irrigation. Here water retention ponds are systematically applied to store water in winter, for use during the dry season. They can play a strategic role in ensuring irrigation water availability, while preserving minimum environmental flow. The paper analyses both the benefits of ponds for the water balance at sub-catchment scale, and the environmental effects produced by ponds having an ecological functionality. We develop an implementation scenario for new ponds, and we appraise the contribution of new ponds whose siting is chosen in order to maximize landscape connectivity. Their hydrological effects are evaluated under present and future climate change scenarios, showing how they may increase water availability for irrigation, while improving the river flow regime. More water for irrigation can favour additional agricultural production, while a more ecologically oriented design of ponds can favour to landscape ecological improvements. The investment costs of ponds are justified in economic terms, and the additional costs of improved design are expected to be balanced by the ecosystem services obtained. The business model required to operate this type of intervention is discussed, together with potential funding channels. We discuss two innovative incentive models based on compensation of land and production lost, and on tradable development rights that can be applied to widely support NBS implementation. © The Authors',\n",
       " 'Phytomanagement is considered a suitable option in line with nature-based solutions to reduce environmental risks associated to metal(loid) mine tailings. We aimed at assessing the effectiveness of biochar from pruning trees combined with compost from urban solid refuse (USR) to ameliorate the conditions of barren acidic (pH ~5.5) metal(loid) mine tailing soils (total concentrations in mg kg−1: As ~220, Cd ~40, Mn ~1800, Pb ~5300 and Zn ~8600) from Mediterranean semiarid areas and promote spontaneous plant colonization. Two months after amendment addition were enough to observe improvements in chemical and physico-chemical tailing soil properties (reduced acidity, salinity and water-soluble metals and increased organic carbon and nutrients content), which resulted in lowered ecotoxicity for the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus. Recalcitrant organic carbon provided by biochar remained in soil whereas labile organic compounds provided by USR were consumed over time. These improvements were consistent for at least one year and led to lower bulk density, higher water retention capacity and higher scores for microbial/functional-related parameters in the amended tailing soil. Spontaneous growth of native vegetation was favored with amendment addition, but adult plants of remarkable size were only found after three years. This highlights the existence of a time-lag between the positive effects of the amendment on tailing soil properties being observed and these improvements being translated into effective spontaneous plant colonization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'In northern Europe, coastal dune remobilization by restoring natural processes is considered by some to maintain the coastal dune in chronically eroding sectors by migrating landward and to restore dune ecology. In wet climatic contexts, this nature-based solution has been shown to induce an increase in both sand bare areas and vegetation diversity. However, it has never been tested in the coastal dunes of southern Europe with a drier climate and, thus, more stressful conditions, where disturbance may inversely decrease vegetation diversity. An original experiment was set up in 2018 on a 4-km stretch of coastal dune in southwest France where Experimental Notches (EN) were excavated in the incipient foredune, referred to as West Experimental Notch (WEN), and in the established foredune, referred as to East Experimental Notch (EEN). Morphological and ecological responses were monitored using UAV photogrammetry and vegetation sampling along transects during two years with contrasted winter storm conditions. During the first winter characterized by calm wind conditions, a rapid filling of the WENs and the initiation of deposition lobes landward of the EENs were observed. Stronger winds during the second winter led to the development of deposition lobes of the EENs, increasing both their volume, up to 6 times, and their cross-shore elongation. The increase in disturbance induced by the notches had a significant impact on vegetation. New sandy bares were colonized by pioneer species leading to an increase in species richness and rejuvenation, in particular landward of the EENs. Although longer-term monitoring is required to draw conclusions, these results suggest that the excavation of foredune notches are able to re-establish an ecomorphological dynamic in the dunes of southwest France on the time scales of years, promoting landward sand transport and, thus, the foredune landward translation, while not threatening diversity. Such approach may become a relevant adaptation strategy to sea level rise and increased erosion in this region of the world. © 2021',\n",

       " 'Adopting nature-based solutions for the bioremediation of oil sands process water (OSPW) is of significant interest, which requires a thorough understanding of how bacterial communities behave within treatment systems operated under natural conditions. This study investigates the OSPW remediation potential of delayed petroleum-coke (PC), which is a byproduct of bitumen upgrading process and is readily available at oil refining sites, in fixed-bed biofilters particularly for the degradation of naphthenic acids (NAs) and aromatics. The biofilters were operated continuously and total and active bacterial communities were studied by DNA and RNA-based amplicon sequencing in a metataxonomic fashion to extrapolate the underlying degradation mechanisms. The results of total community structure indicated a high abundance of aerobic bacteria at all depths of the biofilter, e.g., Porphyrobacter, Legionella, Pseudomonas, Planctomyces. However, redox conditions within the biofilters were anoxic (−153 to −182 mV) that selected anaerobic bacteria to actively participate in the remediation of OSPW, i.e., Ruminicoccus, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Dorea. After 15 days of operation, the removal of classical NAs was recorded up to 20% whereas oxidized NAs species were poorly removed, i.e., O3-NAs: 4.8%, O4-NAs: 1.2%, O5-NAs: 1.7%, and O6-NAs: 0.5%. Accordingly, monoaromatics, diaromatics, and triaromatics were removed up to 16%, 22%, and 15%, respectively. The physiology of the identified genera suggested that the degradation in the PC-based biofilters was most likely proceeded in a scheme similar to beta-oxidation during anaerobic digestion process. The presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens namely Methanobrevibacter and Methanomassiliicoccus and quantification of mcrA gene (2.4 × 102 to 8.7 × 102 copies/mg of PC) revealed that methane production was likely occurring in a syntrophic mechanism during the OSPW remediation. A slight reduction in toxicity was also observed. This study suggests that PC-based biofilters may offer some advantages in the remediation of OSPW; however, the production of methane could be of future concerns if operated at field-scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Existing research stops short of explaining why local stakeholders have a low acceptance of nature-based solutions. In this article, the public, government, and project management perspectives are combined to examine the factors that influence nature-based solutions acceptance at the community level. Based on the survey data of 657 respondents in Guyuan, China, the study has found that government-, and project-related factors are more likely to influence the degree of community acceptance to nature-based solutions through the Bayesian Belief Network. These factors include the availability of feedback and the availability of information from the government perspective and project design and location from the project management perspective. Only one public-related factor is identified to influence community acceptance significantly, namely, personal experiences. In addition, this study found a large portion of respondents belongs to the silent majority in the survey that holds neutral views towards nature-based solutions. Finally, recommendations are given on translating the key determinants for Nature-based solutions that were found into NBS policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Major declines of insect pollinators are a worldwide concern. Such losses threaten human food supplies and ecosystem functions. Monocultures of pastures used to feed cattle are among the drivers of insect pollinator declines in Tropical Latin America. Plants of the legume family (fabaceae) are mostly pollinated by insects, in particular by bees. The inclusion of legumes in pastures (grass-legume system), as forage banks or the development of silvo-pastoral systems (SPS) with tree legumes, has been widely promoted to improve livestock production and soil fertility, but not to enhance ecosystem services from pollinators. Shortages of seed for the establishment of legumes as forage banks or within pastures or SPS remain a bottleneck for the improvement of ecosystem services brought about by pollinators within these systems and beyond. In this perspective paper, we provide an overview of forage legumes, their interplay with pollinators, and the ecological and socio-economic benefits of pollinator–forage legume interactions, at different scales (farm and landscape level). We further discuss the challenges and opportunities of scaling sustainably intensified cattle production systems that integrate legume forage-seed production with principles of pollinator ecology and native beekeeping. Finally, we provide interested stakeholders, policy-and decision-makers with a perspective on how such agroecosystems may be designed and scaled into multifunctional landscapes. © Copyright © 2021 Narjes Sanchez, Cardoso Arango and Burkart.',\n",
       " 'Coral reefs are increasingly recognized for their shoreline protection services. The hydrodynamic performance of this ecosystem is comparable to artificial low-crested structures often used in coastal protection, whose objective is to emulate the former. Coral reefs also provide other important environmental services (e.g., food production, habitat provision, maintenance of biodiversity and social and cultural services) and leave almost no ecological footprint when conservation and restoration actions are conducted to maintain their coastal protection service. However, studies have focused on their flood protection service, but few have evaluated the morphological effects of coral reefs through their ability to avoid or mitigate coastal erosion. In this paper, we investigate the relation between shoreline change, reefs’ geometry and hydrodynamic parameters to elucidate the physics related to how the Mesoamerican Reef in Mexico protects sandy coastlines from erosion. Using numerical wave propagation and historical shoreline change calculated from satellite imagery, a direct correlation was found between shoreline movement, the depths and widths of reef flats, changes in the wave energy flux, and the radiation stresses of breaking waves. The findings indicate that the most remarkable efficacy in preventing beach erosion is due to reefs with shallow crests, wide reef flats, a dissipative lagoon seabed, located at ∼300 m from the coastline. The results provide essential insights for reef restoration projects focused on erosion mitigation and designing artificial reefs in microtidal sandy beaches.

       " 'In many Baltic regions, short-rotation willow (Salix spp.) is used as a vegetation filter for wastewater treatment and recycling of valuable nutrients to upsurge bioeconomy development. In this context, a four-year field trial (2016–2019) was carried out near a wastewater treatment plant in eastern Finland (Outokumpu) to investigate the effect of the processed wastewater (WW) on biomass production as well as the nutrients uptake capability (mainly N and P) by a willow variety (Salix schwerinii). Results indicated that WW irrigation expressively increased the willow diameter growth and biomass yield around 256% and 6510%, respectively, compared to the control treatment site (without WW). The willow was also able to accumulate approximately 41–60% of the N and 32–50% of the P in two years (2018–2019). Overall, willow showed a total 20% mortality rate under WW irrigation throughout the growing periods (2017–2019) as compared to control (39%). The results demonstrate that willow has the potential to control eutrophication (reducing nutrients load) from the wastewater with the best survival rate and can provide high biomass production for bioenergy generations in cold climatic conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Increased global temperatures resulting from anthropogenically induced climate changes have increased the frequency and severity of adverse weather events, including extreme rainfall events, floods, and droughts. In recent years, nature-based solutions (NBS) have been proposed to retain storm runoff temporarily and mitigate flood damages. These practices may help rural farm and forest lands to store runoff and reduce flooding on farms and downstream communities and could be incorporated into a conservation program to provide payments for these efforts, which would supplement traditional farm incomes. Despite their potential, there have been very few methodical assessments and detailed summaries of NBS to date. We identified and summarized potential flood reduction practices for the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. These include agricultural practices of (1) cover cropping/no-till farming; (2) hardpan breakup; (3) pine or (4) hardwood afforestation, and (5) agroforestry; establishing the wetland and stream practices of (6) grass and sedge wetlands and earthen retention structures, (7) forest wetland banks, and (8) stream channel restoration; and establishing new structural solutions of (9) dry dams and berms (water farming) and (10) tile drainage and water retention. These practices offer different water holding and storage capacities and costs. A mixture of practices at the farm and landscape level can be implemented for floodwater retention and attenuation and damage reduction, as well as for providing additional farm and forest ecosystem services. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) in urban regeneration aims to improve citizens’ health and well-being. Therefore, tools need to be applied to identify the most suitable and efficient location and type of NBS. Within the CLEVER-cities H2020 project, the Greenpass method has been chosen to evaluate different design solutions regarding thermal comfort and physiological equivalent temperature (PET), energy, water and air fluxes. The Greenpass system comprises of standardized tools, reports and a unique set of Key Performance Score (KPS) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI). This paper deals with the impact assessment of NBS by the use of the innovative Greenpass system for the CLEVER-cities project ‘Fischbeker Höfe’ in Hamburg, Germany to ensure human health and well-being improvements for the citizens. To that end and considering the climate change context, thermal comfort is a KPI with high relevance in terms of the NBS co-benefits. Based on the PET within a project area Greenpass calculates the Thermal Comfort Score (TCS). The share of the different PET classes within the project area is multiplied with a weighting factor and summarized to the TCS. The results of the climate resilience analysis of the urban development area ‘Fischbeker Höfe’ in Hamburg are presented and discussed in comparison to a conventional architecture that disregards NBS, showing improvement with regards to four out of five KPS. Based on the evaluation results, advice is given to the co-creative design team on how to further improve the design towards climate resilience. The Greenpass system has proven to be a powerful and tailored tool to support climate resilient urban design and architecture. It provides a standardized and comprehensible but still scientific basis for decisions in a highly efficient and understandable way. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Here, we present an application of systems thinking to controlling Baltic Sea eutrophica-tion—a wicked environmental problem characterized by multiple stakeholder perspectives and no single, agreed upon solution. The Baltic Sea is one of the most polluted waterbodies in the world. More than 40 years of land-based (linear) measures have failed to adequately control eutrophication, yet internal (circular) measures are rarely used. Farming native blue mussels for nutrient capture has been proposed as one measure for eutrophication control, but the relevant stakeholders disagree as to its environmental, social and economic benefits. Here, we present the views of four Swedish stakeholder groups—academics, entrepreneurs, municipal government employees and representa-tives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)—on the sustainability of native blue mussel farm-ing, a circular measure for eutrophication control. Using semi-structured interviews, we elicited stakeholder perspectives on the environmental, economic and social dimensions of blue mussel farming. The interviewees generally agreed that blue mussel farming is not currently economically sustainable, but that it can contribute to the social sustainability of coastal regions. Academics were skeptical of the environmental benefits, claiming that farms could reinforce eutrophication, whereas the remaining stakeholder groups argued for its potential to mitigate eutrophication. In a roundtable discussion conducted one year after the original interviews, all stakeholder groups agreed that blue mussel farming alone will not fix Baltic Sea eutrophication, but can be part of the solution together with land-based measures. All groups also agreed on the need for cautious up-scaling, continuous environmental monitoring and constant improvement if blue mussel farms are to be part of a “toolkit” for eutrophication control. Our results highlight the fact that wicked environmental problems can be addressed when multiple stakeholder groups with differing perspectives have the opportunity to achieve consensus through dialog. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Carwash wastewater (CWW) can be a significant source of environmental pollution due to the diversity and high concentrations of contaminants it contains. This toxic wastewater can contain several different heavy metals that if left untreated, can enter surface and sub-surface waters. Innovative, nature-based solutions such as low-impact development (LID) technologies may provide an eco-friendly CWW treatment process that is both effective and affordable. This research reviews the available literature to provide definitive values of flowrate and contaminant concentrations found in CWW around the globe. Dividing LID technologies into two groups, vegetated and unvegetated systems, the authors explored the literature for the general performance of these technologies to sustainably treat heavy metals in CWW. Depending on the car wash’s size and intended purpose, whether cleaning vehicles in agriculture-based rural communities, mining, or in high-density urban environments, volumetric flowrates requiring treatment found in six different countries ranged from 35–400 L/car. CWW also contains a wide range of contaminants at various levels, including COD, turbidity, TDS and TSS, surfactants, oils and greases, and heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, zinc, copper, chromium, and iron. Heavy metal removal by both vegetated and unvegetated LIDs shows mixed results in the literature, but given the different processes involved in both types, the authors propose a system that combines these types in order to provide all the necessary removal processes, including mechanical filtration, adsorption, sedimentation, chemical and biological treatment processes. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Water in the city is typically exploited in a linear process, in which most of it is polluted, treated, and discharged; during this process, valuable nutrients are lost in the treatment process instead of being cycled back and used in urban agriculture or green space. The purpose of this paper is to advance a new paradigm to close water cycles in cities via the implementation of nature‐based solutions units (NBS_u), with a particular focus on building greening elements, such as green roofs (GRs) and vertical greening systems (VGS). The hypothesis is that such “circular systems” can provide substantial ecosystem services and minimize environmental degradation. Our method is twofold: we first examine these systems from a life‐cycle point of view, assessing not only the inputs of conventional and alternative materials, but the ongoing input of water that is required for irrigation. Secondly, the evapotranspiration performance of VGS in Copenhagen, Berlin, Lisbon, Rome, Istanbul, and Tel Aviv, cities with different climatic, architectural, and sociocultural contexts have been simulated using a verticalized ET0 approach, assessing rainwater runoff and greywater as irrigation resources. The water cycling performance of VGS in the mentioned cities would be sufficient at recycling 44% (Lisbon) to 100% (Berlin, Istanbul) of all accruing rainwater roof–runoff, if water shortages in dry months are bridged by greywater. Then, 27–53% of the greywater accruing in a building could be managed on its greened surface. In conclusion, we address the gaps in the current knowledge and policies identified in the different stages of analyses, such as the lack of comprehensive life cycle assessment studies that quantify the complete “water footprint” of building greening systems. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Estuaries have historically been subject to considerable habitat loss, and continue to be subjected to such in areas where the natural landward migration of intertidal habitats is constrained by hard coastal defences. Thus, in estuaries where direct (e.g., port development) or indirect (e.g., sea level rise) processes are predicted to threaten intertidal habitats and associated waterbird species, there is a regulatory requirement to produce compensatory intertidal habitats. Managed realignment (MR) is a shoreline management practise that is undertaken to build sustainable coastal defences and create intertidal habitats in estuaries. This nature-based solution brings multiple benefits in the form of carbon storage, increased resilience to flooding, and, potentially, the formation of new habitats, which is the topic of this study. A 75-ha site at the Paull Holme Strays (Humber Estuary, United Kingdom) was monitored over a 10-year period following MR to examine the change in the abundance of waterbirds in the chosen site in response to the physical processes occurring there. Using digital terrain models (DTMs) collected via light detection and ranging (LiDAR), we examined how four compensatory target species responded to changes in elevation after the creation of the site. It was shown that the very rapid accretion of estuarine sediment occurred in the first decade of the new re-created intertidal, which, over time, led to changes in the numbers of benthic foraging birds supported. Furthermore, elevation change was also driven by this sediment accretion, the rate of which depended on the initial bed elevation of the sectors within the site. Ten years after the recreation of the habitat, the spatial heterogeneity in the bed elevation remained high; however, the sectors with the lowest elevations accreted the most over the 10-year period. The foraging number of the four waterbird species that colonised the MR site significantly declined above a certain elevation, with this effect being most pronounced for the Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata). The number of common shelducks (Tadorna tadorna), dunlins (Calidris alpina), and common redshanks (Tringa totanus) declined significantly after initial peaks 5–7 years after the creation of the site, reflecting the ongoing elevation changes. Thus, this study highlighted the need for long-term studies to understand how species respond to large-scale habitat construction. It can also aid in predicting the suitability of an MR site for waterbirds in the medium and long term. © Copyright © 2021 Mander, Scapin, Thaxter, Forster and Burton.',\n",
       " 'With the increasing spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, restrictions on public life were strengthened across the world. Non-pharmaceutical interventions like stay-at-home orders, cancellations of events, work from home, etc. are the first line of defence to combat the spread of highly transmittable infections like Covid-19. But these interventions create whole new situations that urban residents need to cope with, which often creates mental distress. Home gardens, due to their therapeutic benefits, can help individuals to relax and unwind, thus reduce mental distress. Hence, the present study attempts to investigate whether home gardens moderate the effects on mental distress from confinement at homes due to the enforcement of stay-at-home orders. Samples (N=408) were collected through an online question survey with urban residents across different parts of India. Moderation analysis reported the significant effect of home gardens in lowering mental distress. Further analysis with time spent in home gardens revealed that with increasing time spent from less than 10 min to more than 2 h, an individual score of stress and anxiety, and overall Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)-21 scores had significantly decreased. These findings illustrate the beneficial properties of naturebased solutions, home gardens in this case, in improving mental health, even during the difficult times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results suggest the necessity of scaling up these nature-based solutions in urban planning processes to make the residents healthy and resilient. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognized the importance of forests in combating climate change and agreed upon financial support for REDD+ activities in developing countries through the Warsaw REDD+ Framework (WRF). The REDD+ activities for conserving carbon stored in forests to reduce GHG emissions and to enhance the carbon sink function of forests are expected to serve as an important means for achieving the climatic goal. In this study, a set of criteria was devised to assess the REDD+ Measuring, Reporting, and Verifying (MRV) implementation capabilities of developing countries, which was applied to analyze the REDD+ MRV levels in REDD+ countries. Based on the Forest Reference Emission Level/Forest Reference Level (FREL/FRL), National Strategy (NS), National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) and Safeguard Information Summary (SIS) the countries submitted, 36 REDD+ countries submitted only the FREL/FRL (Group I), while 5 countries fulfilled the WRF requirements and registered REDD+ reduction results (Group II), and 6 received Results-Based Payments (RBP) (Group III). From longest to shortest, the periods for which the International Fund provided support were arranged in the order of Group III, II, and I, verifying the relative importance of international support. From highest to lowest, the overall MRV capability was also arranged in the order of Group III, II, and I, although Group I or Group II was at a higher level than the other groups in some elements. REDD+ countries in the Readiness Phase (Group I) would aim to have the MRV capabilities of Groups II and III to receive RBP, and international support for REDD+ MRV capacity building could enable them to do. However, in addition to the receipt of RBP, REDD+ should be reflected in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) as consistent reduction results at the national GHG inventory level, and the advancement of REDD+ MRV is expected to be a necessary and sufficient condition for REDD+ cooperation under the Paris Agreement cooperative approach framework. For the following groups, international cooperation is essential. Countries in the Readiness Phase need to be supported with the establishment of an MRV framework, which will enable them to achieve REDD+ to receive RBP and be reflected in NDCs. For REDD+ countries that have thus far met the WRF requirements, the REDD+ scope needs to be upscaled to national levels, and the MRV system should be further advanced to establish a cooperative approach system that can achieve more ambitious reduction targets through forests. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly promoted to mitigate urbanization effects, such as the urban heat island. The release of latent heat requires the availability of water in the urban soils. Models able to represent both detailed water and energy budgets are needed for a reliable evaluation of NBSs performances. The TEB-Hydro model is a recent hydro-microclimate model that extends the physics of the urban microclimate model TEB-Veg to water processes in urban subsoil in order to represent more realistically coupled water and energy budgets. Hence, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the TEB-Hydro model regarding how the water processes affect the energy balance. The model is applied to an urban French catchment for which both hydrological and microclimate data are continuously collected. The model shows general good performances in both simulating latent and sensible heat fluxes. Nevertheless, soil water contents are slightly underestimated during wet periods and overestimated during dry periods. Compared to the previous version of the model (TEB-Veg) with a simplified water budget, TEB-Hydro tends to more overestimate latent heat fluxes than TEB-Veg during dry periods. During wet periods, however, TEB-Hydro simulates better sensible heat fluxes and latent heat fluxes. © 2021 The Authors',\n",

However, despite the wide range of approaches to eco-hydromorphological characterization, the analysis of fluvial dynamics and their drivers under a temporal perspective requires more investigation. For the present study, a historical analysis of river-floodplain dynamics has been undertaken in a study section of the Duero River upstream of Zamora (Spain), within the framework of the DRAINAGE project for the integral management of flood risk. Aerial imagery for the period 1945–2017 was used to create habitat maps that were subsequently intersected to identify trajectories of habitat change (anthropization, changeless, progression, and regression). In addition, a Natural Trajectory Index (NTI) and an Anthropization Ratio (AR) were proposed as a way to assess the balance of natural trajectories (progression vs. regression) and the weight of anthropization versus the sum of natural trajectories, respectively. Results show a system with a high degree of stability and anthropization, and a current imbalance of natural trajectories with a predominance of progression in the ecological succession. Rejuvenation processes have to be reactivated through nature-based solutions, allowing for more sustainable water management practices. This perspective aims at promoting a more resilient system.

Despite many studies on barrier island dynamics, few have investigated the impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) on sandspits. In peri-urban settings, we hypothesised that shoreline environment change would be strongly dependent on contemporary land use decisions, whilst modern engineering capabilities also present new opportunities for working with nature. Our study site in Christchurch, New Zealand, included a unique example of SLR caused by tectonic subsidence and an associated managed retreat initiative. We used a novel scenario modelling approach to evaluate both shorelines simultaneously for 0.25m SLR increments and incorporating open coast sediment supply in 25-year periods. Our key questions addressed the potential impacts of shoreline change on open coast dune and estuarine-coast saltmarsh ecosystems and implications for the role of ‘nature-based’ climate change solutions. The results identify challenges for dune conservation, with a third of the dune system eliminated in the ‘1-m SLR in 100-year’ scenario. The associated exposure of urban areas to natural hazards such as extreme storms and tsunami will likely fuel demand for seawalls unless natural alternatives can be enabled. In contrast, the managed retreat initiative on the backshore presents an opportunity to restart saltmarsh accretion processes seaward of coastal defences with the potential to reverse decades of degradation. Considering both shorelines simultaneously highlights the existence of pinch-points from opposing forces that result in small land volumes above the tidal range. Societal adaptation is delicately poised between the paradigms of resisting or accommodating nature and challenged by the long perimeter and confined nature of the sandspit feature. The use of innovative policy measures in disaster recovery contexts, as highlighted here, may offer a beneficial framework for enabling nature-based solutions to climate change and natural hazards. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " \"There is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale forest restoration in the Amazon as a 'nature-based solution' to climate change. However, our knowledge of forest loss and recovery beyond Brazil is limited, and carbon emissions and accumulation have not been estimated for the whole biome. Combining a 33 year land cover dataset with estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration rates, we evaluate forest loss and recovery across nine Amazonian countries and at a local scale. We also estimate the role of secondary forests in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions and explore the temporal trends in forest loss and recovery. We find secondary forests across the biome to have offset just 9.7% of carbon emissions from old-growth deforestation, despite occupying 28.8% of deforested land. However, these numbers varied between countries ranging from 9.0% in Brazil to 23.8% in Guyana for carbon offsetting, and 24.8% in Brazil to 56.9% in Ecuador for forest area recovery. We reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest potential for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery (e.g. Brazil dominates deforestation and emissions but has the lowest recovery). In addition, a temporal analysis of the regions that were >80% deforested in 1997 shows a continued decline in overall forest cover. Our findings identify three important challenges: (a) incentivising large-scale restoration in highly deforested regions, (b) protecting secondary forests without disadvantaging landowners who depend on farm-fallow systems, and (c) preventing further deforestation. Combatting all these successfully is essential to ensuring that the Amazon biome achieves its potential in mitigating anthropogenic climate change. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'Active nitrifiers and rapid nitrification are major contributing factors to nitrogen losses in global wheat production. Suppressing nitrifier activity is an effective strategy to limit N losses from agriculture. Production and release of nitrification inhibitors from plant roots is termed “biological nitrification inhibition” (BNI). Here, we report the discovery of a chromosome region that controls BNI production in “wheat grass” Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tzvelev, located on the short arm of the “Lr#3Nsb” (Lr#n), which can be transferred to wheat as T3BL.3NsbS (denoted Lr#n-SA), where 3BS arm of chromosome 3B of wheat was replaced by 3NsbS of L. racemosus. We successfully introduced T3BL.3NsbS into the wheat cultivar “Chinese Spring” (CS-Lr#n-SA, referred to as “BNI-CS”), which resulted in the doubling of its BNI capacity. T3BL.3NsbS from BNI-CS was then transferred to several elite high-yielding hexaploid wheat cultivars, leading to near doubling of BNI production in “BNI-MUNAL” and “BNI-ROELFS.” Laboratory incubation studies with root-zone soil from field-grown BNI-MUNAL confirmed BNI trait expression, evident from suppression of soil nitrifier activity, reduced nitrification potential, and N2O emissions. Changes in N metabolism included reductions in both leaf nitrate, nitrate reductase activity, and enhanced glutamine synthetase activity, indicating a shift toward ammonium nutrition. Nitrogen uptake from soil organic matter mineralization improved under low N conditions. Biomass production, grain yields, and N uptake were significantly higher in BNI-MUNAL across N treatments. Grain protein levels and breadmaking attributes were not negatively impacted. Wide use of BNI functions in wheat breeding may combat nitrification in high N input-intensive farming but also can improve adaptation to low N input marginal areas. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

       " 'In response to the environmental damage caused by urbanization, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are being implemented to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem processes with mutual benefits for society and nature. Although the field of NbS is flourishing, experiments in different geographic locations and environmental contexts have produced variable results, with knowledge particularly lacking for the subtidal zone. This study tested the effects of physical complexity on colonizing communities in subtidal habitats in two urban locations: (1) Plymouth, United Kingdom (northeast Atlantic) and (2) Tel Aviv, Israel (eastern Mediterranean) for 15- and 12-months, respectively. At each location, physical complexity was manipulated using experimental tiles that were either flat or had 2.5 or 5.0 cm ridges. In Plymouth, biological complexity was also manipulated through seeding tiles with habitat-forming mussels. The effects of the manipulations on taxon and functional richness, and community composition were assessed at both locations, and in Plymouth the survival and size of seeded mussels and abundance and size of recruited mussels were also assessed. Effects of physical complexity differed between locations. Physical complexity did not influence richness or community composition in Plymouth, while in Tel Aviv, there were effects of complexity on community composition. In Plymouth, effects of biological complexity were found with mussel seeding reducing taxon richness, supporting larger recruited mussels, and influencing community composition. Our results suggest that outcomes of NbS experiments are context-dependent and highlight the risk of extrapolating the findings outside of the context in which they were tested. © Copyright © 2021 O’Shaughnessy, Perkol-Finkel, Strain, Bishop, Hawkins, Hanley, Lunt, Thompson, Hadary, Shirazi, Yunnie, Amstutz, Milliet, Yong and Firth.',\n",
       " 'Green infrastructure has a role to play in climate change adaptation strategies in cities. Alternative urban spaces should be designed considering new requirements in terms of urban microclimate and thermal comfort. Pervious pavements such as green parking lots can contribute to this goal through solar evaporative cooling. However, the cooling benefits of such systems remain under debate during dry and warm periods. The aim of this study was to compare experimentally the thermal behavior of different parking lot types (PLTs) with vegetated urban soil. Four parking lots were instrumented, with temperature probes buried at different depths. Underground temperatures were measured during summer 2019, and the hottest days of the period were analyzed. Results show that the less mineral used in the surface coating, the less it warms up. The temperature difference at the upper layer can reach 10 °C between mineral and non-mineral PLTs. PLTs can be grouped into three types: (i) high surface temperature during daytime and nighttime, important heat transfer toward the sublayers, and low time shift (asphalt system); (ii) high (resp. low) surface temperature during daytime (resp. nighttime), weak heat transfer toward the sublayers, and important time shift (paved stone system); and (iii) low surface temperature during daytime and nighttime, weak heat transfer toward the sublayers, and important time shift (vegetation and substrate system, wood chips system, vegetated urban soil). The results of this study underline that pervious pavements demonstrate thermal benefits under warm and dry summer conditions compared to conventional parking lot solutions. The results also indicate that the hygrothermal properties of urban materials are crucial for urban heat island mitigation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Entering the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, interventions referred to as nature-based solutions (NBS) are at the forefront of the sustainability discourse. While applied in urban, natural forest or wetland ecosystems, they are underutilized in agricultural landscapes. This paper presents a technical framework to characterise NBS in agricultural systems. NBS in the agriculture sector is proposed as “the use of natural processes or elements to improve ecosystem functions of environments and landscapes affected by agricultural practices, and to enhance livelihoods and other social and cultural functions, over various temporal and spatial scales.” The framework emerges from a review of 188 peer-reviewed articles on NBS and green infrastructure published between 2015 and 2019 and three international expert consultations organized in 2019–2020. The framework establishes four essential functions for NBS in agriculture: 1) Sustainable practices — with a focus on production; 2) Green Infrastructure — mainly for engineering purposes such as water and soil, and slope stabilization; 3) Amelioration — for restoration of conditions for plants, water, soil or air and climate change mitigation; and 4) Conservation — focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem connectivity. The framework connects the conventional divide between production and conservation to add functionality, purpose and scale in project design. The review confirmed limited evidence of NBS in agricultural systems particularly in developing country contexts, although specific technologies feature under other labels. Consultations indicated that wider adoption will require a phased approach to generate evidence, while integrating NBS in national and local policies and agricultural development strategies. The paper concludes with recommended actions required to facilitate such processes. © Copyright © 2021 Simelton, Carew-Reid, Coulier, Damen, Howell, Pottinger-Glass, Tran and Van Der Meiren.',\n",

To meet the annual fish, tomato, and lettuce demand of Berlin’s 3.77 million residents would require approximately 370 aquaponic facilities covering a total area of 224 hectares and the use of different combinations of fish and crops: catfish/tomato (56%), catfish/lettuce (13%), and tilapia/tomato (31%). As a predominant effect, in terms of water, aquaponic production would save about 2.0 million m3 of water compared to the baseline. On the supply-side, we identified significant causal link chains concerning the Food-Water-Energy nexus at the aquaponic facility level as well as causal relations of a production relocation to Berlin. On the demand-side, a ‘freshwater pescatarian diet’ is discussed. The new and comprehensive findings at different system levels require further investigations on this topic. Upscaled aquaponics can produce a relevant contribution to Berlin’s sustainability and to implement it, research is needed to find suitable sites for local aquaponics in Berlin, possibly inside buildings, on urban roofscape, or in peri-urban areas. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Few Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are financed voluntarily by corpora-tions. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that limited literature on the theory and practice of PES has a dedicated focus on businesses. This article unifies the PES and business literatures in order to address the awareness and management challenges that corporations face in engaging in PES. First, it shows how corporations fit into the economic theory that underpins PES, demonstrating that corporate-financed PES schemes can exhibit a diversity and hybridity of Coasean and Pigouvian characteristics. Second, it shows how PES fits into corporate sustainability theory, demonstrating how PES can help companies achieve synergies across the economic, environmental, and social tenets of the triple bottom line; for example, by helping gain social license to operate from adjacent communities, or by using PES to meet sustainability reporting requirements related to emissions and water management. Third, it shows the different PES options available to firms based on their industrial sector, operating practices, and business strategies. The options with higher potential are maintenance and enhancement of production inputs across the supply chain, and carbon offsetting and insetting to help meet climate change mitigation regulations and avoid fines. Fourth, it identifies lessons learned when transitioning from theory to practice by synthesising the latest empirical research on corporate-financed PES schemes—considering exactly what these ‘should’ or ‘could’ resemble, for example, in terms of their additionality, conditionality, permanence, co-benefits, budgeting, and bargaining. Examples are drawn from corporate-financed schemes in forests and watersheds across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. The article concludes that these schemes remain small in number and size, but have significant potential to increase—and this can be aided by future research on corporate motives, understandings, and actions on PES. © 2021 by the author.

       " 'Urban greenspace (UGS) represents an essential component of city ecosystems. It plays a critical role for various purposes, such as reducing urban heat island effect and air pollution, regulating torrential run-off and offering joyful routes for walking, jogging and cycling based on personal interest as well as a platform for social networking. It is especially important in a populated country like Taiwan with population highly concentrated in cities. It is rather vulnerable to strong winds and heavy precipitation brought up by typhoons, while there are no existing frameworks to access its vulnerability to typhoons in Taiwan. Here, we examine the vulnerability of UGS to typhoons in Taiwan by a novel assessment framework considering 21 indicators organized into three dimensions, including hazard, exposure/sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The 21 indicators are derived from the Sentinel-2 MSI data obtained from European Space Agency (ESA), typhoon data acquired from Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA), and census data achieved by the government official sites of Taiwan. Google Earth Engine and GIS are used to analyze the deviation of UGS variables. Five major metropolitan areas of Taiwan are selected as the study sites, consisting of Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, and Kaohsiung cities. Interestingly, it is found that (i) There exists a great spatial gap between hazard levels and the top-priority regions to enhance the strategies and adaptive capacity in order to better respond to typhoons in Taiwan; (ii) The Northern and middle parts of Taiwan exhibit high and very high hazard levels since the occurrence frequency and wind speed of typhoons are higher. In contrast, the Southern Taiwan is characterized by low and very low hazard levels occupying over approximately half of the study sites; (iii) Exposure and sensitivity of the UGS in Taiwan vary greatly from very low to very high levels over the study sites with 43 % attributed to high and very high levels; and (iv) 22 % of the metropolitan areas are classified as high and very high vulnerable, mainly distributed over the Taoyuan, Taichung, Taipei, and New Taipei cities. Results suggest that the presented framework is useful in evaluating the vulnerability of UGS to typhoons and implicates proper management of urban trees as a nature-based solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'This paper explores the potential of ‘Land Value Capture’ in addressing the shortfall in funding to address the biodiversity crisis through a series of interviews with Local Planning Authority officers in England. It finds heterogeneity in their responses to financial austerity and imperatives to deliver development, which heavily influences developer contribution (DC) practice. The response to these pressures differed depending upon localised planning culture and its interrelation with behavioural biases, which defined the scope of officer agency to influence developer contribution outcomes. Most LPAs placed a strong emphasis upon securing real estate investment to drive economic growth and to provide opportunities to secure DC to address socio-economic issues, with the status quo bias contributing towards inertia in policy and practice change. Elsewhere, there was a greater emphasis placed upon reconciling the need to deliver development with the preservation of environmental amenity, enabling officers to carefully frame practice changes, to successfully secure funding for ecological mitigation programs. The paper illustrates the cultural and behavioural challenges in implementing DC policy change to support funding these priorities, whilst this may be overcome by legislative changes, integrating these may be compromised by resource limitations whilst also affecting the existing delivery of public goods. © The Author(s) 2021.',\n",
       " 'Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production and storage are limited by numerous constraints. Insect pests are often the most destructive. However, resource-constrained smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often do little to manage pests. Where farmers do use a control strategy, it typically relies on chemical pesticides, which have adverse effects on the wildlife, crop pollinators, natural enemies, mammals, and the development of resistance by pests. Nature-based solutions —in particular, using biological control agents with sustainable approaches that include biopesticides, resistant varieties, and cultural tools—are alternatives to chemical control. However, significant barriers to their adoption in SSA include a lack of field data and knowledge on the natural enemies of pests, safety, efficacy, the spectrum of activities, the availability and costs of biopesticides, the lack of sources of resistance for different cultivars, and spatial and temporal inconsistencies for cultural methods. Here, we critically review the control options for bean pests, particularly the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) and pod borers (Maruca vitrata). We identified natural pest regulation as the option with the greatest potential for this farming system. We recommend that farmers adapt to using biological control due to its compatibility with other sustainable approaches, such as cultural tools, resistant varieties, and biopesticides for effective management, especially in SSA. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Adverse effects of climate change are increasing around the world and the floods are posing significant challenges for water managers. With climate projections showing increased risks of storms and extreme precipitation, the use of traditional measures alone is no longer an option. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) offer a suitable alternative to reduce the risk of flooding and provide multiple benefits. However, planning such interventions requires careful consideration of various factors and local contexts. The present paper provides contribution in this direction and it proposes a methodology for allocation of large-scale NBS using suitability mapping. The methodology was implemented within the toolboxes of ESRI ArcMap software in order to map suitability for four types of NBS interventions: floodplain restoration, detention basins, retention ponds, and river widening. The toolboxes developed were applied to the case study area in Serbia, i.e., the Tamnava River basin. Flood maps were used to determine the volume of floodwater that needs to be stored for reducing flood risk in the basin and subsequent downstream areas. The suitability maps produced indicate the potential of the new methodology and its application as a decision-support tool for selection and allocation of large-scale NBS. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'The rising environmental issues on contemporary cities urgently calls for sustainable planning policies. Implementation of nature-based solutions, ecosystem services, and green infrastructures associated to green spaces management is at present of paramount importance. In contrast to policies mainly focused on public greenery, the inclusion of private green in planning strategies might be a promising pathway. The general aim is mapping and classifying urban green spaces in Padua, a city of 93.3 km2 (Northeast Italy). Specific aims are (i) testing an NDVI-derived extraction from very high-resolution orthophotos; (ii) classifying property status; (iii) highlighting multilevel relationships and strategies for urban green spaces implementation and management; (iv) assessing greenery in relation to per capita population. By performing remote sensing and GIS analyses, a first detailed global map of urban green spaces in Padua was created; then, binary classification and thematic maps for rural/non-rural, public/private, municipal/non-municipal greenery were produced for all urban units. Results show that, among total green spaces (52.23 km2 ), more than half are rural. Moreover, private green spaces represent 80%, while within public areas (20%) less than 10% are municipal (5 km2). We therefore highlight scenarios for planning policies in Padua by providing tools to policymakers for an integrated management of green spaces, where private greenery might also contribute to ecosystem services implementation for common urban well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Seven treatment wetlands and a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were weekly monitored over the course of one year for removal of conventional wastewater parameters, selected micropollutants (caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, benzotriazole, diclofenac, acesulfame, and carbamazepine) and biological effects. The treatment wetland designs investigated include a horizontal subsurface flow (HF) wetland and a variety of wetlands with intensification (aeration, two-stages, or reciprocating flow). Complementary to the common approach of analyzing individual chemicals, in vitro bioassays can detect the toxicity of a mixture of known and unknown components given in a water sample. A panel of five in vitro cell-based reporter gene bioassays was selected to cover environmentally relevant endpoints (AhR: indicative of activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor; PPARγ: binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; ERα: activation of the estrogen receptor alpha; GR: activation of the glucocorticoid receptor; oxidative stress response). While carbamazepine was persistent in the intensified treatment wetlands, mean monthly mass removal of up to 51% was achieved in the HF wetland. The two-stage wetland system showed highest removal efficacy for all biological effects (91% to >99%). The removal efficacy for biological effects ranged from 56% to 77% for the HF wetland and 60% to 99% for the WWTP. Bioanalytical equivalent concentrations (BEQs) for AhR, PPARγ, and oxidative stress response were often below the recommended effect-based trigger (EBT) values for surface water, indicating the great benefit for using nature-based solutions for water treatment. Intensified treatment wetlands remove both individual micropollutants and mixture effects more efficiently than conventional (non-aerated) HF wetlands, and in some cases, the WWTP. © 2021',\n",
       " 'Coastal areas are often subject to the severe consequences of flooding from intense storms or hurricanes. Increases in coastal development have amplified both flooding intensity and negative impacts for coastal communities. Reductions in pervious land cover and replacement with impervious ones have reduced the amount of ecosystem services. This research examines the services provided by nature-based solutions by applying outputs from Co$ting Nature models into suitability models to quantify ecosystem services along the Texas Coast. Results show that only around 13% of the Houston-Galveston coastal area has relatively high NBS, and nearly ¼ of the area shows relatively low NBS. The majority of the areas lie in the middle, which, due to increases in development, are at particular risk for becoming areas offering low NBS in the future if not treated. Such vulnerability assessment informs future implementation strategies for NBS in coastal communities to protect people and property from flooding. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Scaled up planning and implementation of nature-based solutions requires better understanding of broad characteristics (typologies) of the current governance and financing landscape, collaborative approaches amidst local complexities, and factors of scalability. An inventory was compiled of water-related ecological infrastructure intervention projects in two river systems in South Africa, incorporating actor, environmental, social, and financial dimensions and benefits. Qualitative participatory analysis revealed eight typologies. Post-hoc classification analysis determined similarities and/or unique characteristics of seven quantitative typologies. Key characterising factors included the complexity/size of financial flows, complexity of partnership/governance arrangements, mandates/goals of actors, type of ecological infrastructure, trade-offs in investment in ecological/built infrastructure, and the model used for social benefits. Identified scalable typologies offer structures suited to increased investment, with other typologies offering specialised local value. A range of ecological infrastructure intervention typologies with differing biophysical and socioeconomic outcomes provide choices for investors with specific goals, and benefits to landscape actors. © 2021, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.',\n",
       " 'In Latin America and the Caribbean, river restoration projects are increasing, but many lack strategic planning and monitoring. We tested the applicability of a rapid visual social–ecological stream assessment method for restoration planning, complemented by a citizen survey on perceptions and uses of blue and green infrastructure. We applied the method at three urban streams in Jarabacoa (Dominican Republic) to identify and prioritize preferred areas for nature-based solutions. The method provides spatially explicit information for strategic river restoration planning, and its efficiency makes it suitable for use in data-poor contexts. It identifies well-preserved, moderately altered, and critically impaired areas regarding their hydromorphological and socio-cultural conditions, as well as demands on green and blue infrastructure. The transferability of the method can be improved by defining reference states for assessing the hydromorphology of tropical rivers, refining socio-cultural parameters to better address river services and widespread urban challenges, and balancing trade-offs between ecological and social restoration goals. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'The strategy of reconnecting rivers with their floodplains currently gains popularity because it not only harnesses natural capacities of floodplains but also increases social co-benefits and biodiversity. In this paper, we present an example of a successfully implemented nature-based solution (NBS) in the Dijle valley in the centre of Belgium. The research objective is to retrospectively assess cost and benefit differences between a technical solution (storm basins) and an alternative NBS, here the restoration of the alluvial floodplain. The method is a comparative social cost–benefit analysis. The case study analysis reveals similar flood security, lower costs, more ecosystem services benefits and higher biodiversity values associated with the NBS option in comparison to the technical alternative. However, the business case for working with NBS depends substantially on the spatial and socio-ecological context. Chances for successful NBS implementation increase in conditions of sufficient space to retain flood water, when flood water is of sufficient quality, and when economic activity and housing in the floodplain is limited. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'The conversion of old brownfield sites into places once again serving society is becoming an upward global trend, especially in urban areas. Due to the increasingly growing pressure on the expansion of urban green spaces, such sites can become, for instance, urban parks. The aim of the study was to assess whether the solution is appropriate and if it does not pose a potential health risk. Heavy pollution of soils was found out by means of the example of the urban park newly established in a reclaimed area of a historic mining town. The high average values in the topsoil were found out mainly in As (132 mg/kg), Cd (6.8 mg/kg), Pb (535 mg/kg) and Zn (1604 mg/kg). The assessment of the non-carcinogenic health risk has revealed possible As-related adverse health effects in children even at irregular park visits. According to the carcinogenic risk assessment, As, Cd, Cr and Ni can be ranked in the category of an acceptable total risk for regulatory purposes. The health status of park vegetation as a significant component of the urban ecosystem was also assessed. Soil phytotoxicity brought about severe damage to the seedlings, with a mortality rate of up to 84% locally. The results indicate that heavily polluted brownfield sites with historic mining-related activities are not suitable for establishing urban parks even after reclamation and nature-based solutions may not be invariably appropriate. Based on the findings, the management steps that ought to be implemented in the process of brownfield redevelopment into the urban park even after its establishment have been highlighted in order to minimize the health risk to park visitors while providing the required ecosystem services by vegetation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Green roofs are widely considered as a promising nature-based solution for urban stormwater management. In this study, the stormwater retention and detention performance of 6 green roof modules with different types and depth of substrates at Beijing, China was investigated through 3-year continuous monitoring. The Hydrus-1D was applied to further explore the stormwater management performance of green roofs under extreme storms. The average event-based stormwater retention and detention rates of the green roofs with 10 cm substrates ranged between 81% and 87%, and 83%–87%, respectively; and the average time delays in runoff generation and peak discharge ranged between 82 and 210 min, and 63–131 min, respectively. Green roofs with 15 cm depth of substrates offered higher stormwater retention and peak runoff attenuation rates than those with 10 cm substrates. However, due to the high frequency (55 out of total 92) of light rainfall events (<10 mm) and short antecedent dry weather periods (3.8 days in average), no significant difference was found on stormwater control performance of those green roofs. The Hydrus-1D simulations revealed that green roof stormwater retention rate decreases exponentially with return periods of extreme storms but increases with substrate depth. There exists a critical depth of substrates and further increases in substrate depth beyond this critical value could not bring much improvement in stormwater retention performance of green roofs. The application of extensive green roofs with 10–15 cm substrates provides promising stormwater retention and detention performance in highly urbanized area of Beijing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'While being major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters, cities also suffer some of the most severe climate change impacts. Urban forests have gained increasing recognition as nature-based solutions to climate change via the various benefits they provide, such as carbon sequestration and temperature regulation. Many cities have developed climate change and/or urban forest policies to enhance climate resilience and support urban livability. However, it is still unclear whether these policies consider and address potential alignment between climate action and urban forest planning and management. This study explored whether and to what extent urban forest and climate change policies are mutually supportive and reinforcing, by conducting a review of climate change and urban forest policies in the largest 20 Canadian cities. Results suggest significant gaps and discrepancies between these policies, across and within study cities, indicating potential weaknesses related to stakeholder/actor engagement, policy integration, departmental collaboration and communication, and cohesive management priorities and practices. Only three (15 %) of the cities have developed climate change and urban forest policies that align to some extent. Furthermore, despite some commonalities, most cities defined their urban forests differently, highlighting locally-specific understanding and needs in addition to a lack of cohesion across Canadian municipalities concerning urban forest planning and management. Across most cities, both types of policies included general and locally-relevant information related to impacts of climate change. However, gaps and inconsistencies found between and within many municipalities’ policies may present a major barrier to effective policy implementation and mutually-reinforcing management actions. Areas for improvement are suggested for policy planning and implementation to ensure alignment between urban forest and climate change policies, which should also prove useful for municipalities outside of the study scope. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Nature based solutions are proposed as integrated solutions to transform the current water intensive economic model to a more balanced model, where water is considered as an eco-social asset. We analyse the logic of action and underpinning belief systems, values, and norms of these evolving economic (and underpinning value) systems, through a conceptual frame based on a three layered institutional framework, considering new institutional economics and old institutionalism. This is applied to the case study of an intensively used aquifer of Medina del Campo in Spain, in relation to drought and water scarcity. We examine how water scarcity and drought are framed, and the implicit underpinning economic development models and values that help to legitimise decisions. It offers an application of the potential for natural assurance schemes as a specific type of nature based solutions to create safe landscapes and help transform the system through deep territorial transformation, based on a wider and deeper range of eco-social values. Systems which are more adaptable under climate change. The analysis of the definition of the problem (through individual stakeholder interviews) and the co-design of preferred choices through a series of participatory workshops led to the consideration of a wider range of options by stakeholders. We conclude that in Medina del Campo, the de-construction of the values and beliefs underpinning the concept of water scarcity as a problem, helps to re-construct adaptation to water scarcity as an opportunity for a more diversified and resilient economic model for long-term development. This is reflected in the selection of hybrid nature-based strategies (as compared to sole grey infrastructure strategies) that incorporate a broader range of values shifting from the single prioritisation of provision services to understanding water as a eco-social asset, encompassing the full range of ecosystem services, thus opening the decision-making space for additional long term climate resilient development. © 2021',\n",
       " 'Predictive tools are widely used to study coastal and deltaic systems in support of basic research, planning efforts, engineering design, and the implementation of restoration or protection strategies. They have been extensively used to evaluate the effectiveness of natural and nature-based solutions (NNBS) to support ecosystem functions and services of coastal ecosystems and human communities experiencing increased risk from sea-level rise and severe storms. The potential benefits of NNBS are being increasingly recognized, particularly in remote areas or areas that are either technically or financially infeasible to be protected with levees or other difficult engineering alternatives. Local communities, however, are often excluded from proposing, screening, or evaluating NNBS as restoration and protection strategies. Communities are also not sufficiently involved in the development or application of the predictive tools. This research effort outlines an approach to developing knowledge-based predictive tools and a community engagement process to evaluate NNBS strategies proposed predominantly by local communities. Incorporating knowledge from local communities benefits and potentially improves the performance of predictive tools and their ability to capture visible trends and observations. To illustrate this concept, the authors present landscape models for coastal Louisiana that successfully reproduced the frequency of flooding of local roads, rate of shoreline erosion, salinity pattern changes, and presence/absence of key species (e.g., brown shrimp, oysters, and so forth). While these qualitative measures are not a substitute for well-established rigorous and quantitative model performance assessment approaches, they offer an effective approach to engage local communities and incorporate their knowledge in the development of the predictive models and the proposed protection and restoration strategies to be examined. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

In this review, we examine how unique NbS characteristics relate to public acceptance through a comparison with grey measures, and we identify influential acceptance factors related to individuals, society, and DRR measures. Based on the review, we introduce the PA-NbS model that highlights the role of risk perception, trust, competing societal interests, and ecosystem services.

       " 'The quality of water in many urban rivers in Latin America is increasingly degrading due to wastewater and runoff discharges from urban sprawl. Due to deficits in sanitary drainage systems, greywater is discharged to the stormwater drainage network generating a continuous dry-weather runoff that reaches rivers without treatment. One of the main challenges in the region is to achieve sustainable management of urban runoff for the recovery of rivers ecosystem integrity. However, retrofitting conventional centralized wastewater drainage networks into the existing urban grid represents important social, economic and technical challenges. This paper presents an alternative adaptive methodology for the design of Nature-based Solutions for decentralized urban runoff treatment. Through this study, technical solutions commonly used for stormwater management were adapted for dry-weather runoff treatment and co-designed for the particular conditions of a representative study area, considering space availability as the main constraining factor for retrofitting in urban areas. The application of a co-design process in a dense neighbourhood of the Great Metropolitan area of Costa Rica brought to light valuable insights about conditions that could be hindering the implementation of NBS infrastructures in Latin America. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Decentralized Nature-based Solutions such as Urban Green Infrastructures (UGI) are increasingly promoted to reduce flooding in urban areas. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of flood control of UGI at a plot or neighbourhood level. Modelling approaches that extrapolate their flood reducing impact to larger catchment scales are often based on a simplistic assumption of different percentages of UGI implementation. Additionally, such approaches typically do not consider the suitable space for UGI and potential implementation constraints. This study proposes a scenario development and modelling approach for a more realistic upscaling of UGI based on empirical insights from a representative neighbourhood. The results from this study, conducted in the metropolitan area of Costa Rica, show that upscaling the full potential for UGI could significantly reduce surface runoff, peak flows, and flood volumes. In particular, the permeable pavement has the highest potential for flood reducing in public space while cisterns perform best at the property level. These results can guide the formation of policies that promote UGI. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",

In a one-day Geodesign process, eleven stakeholders delineated priority areas, changed land uses, and observed resulting impacts on ecosystem services. Contributions to boundary management were evaluated regarding translation, communication and mediation functions, as well as perceived attributions of credibility, salience, and legitimacy. Results include spatial NBS scenarios and insights into contributions to boundary management: translating scenario stories into maps differed depending on the stakeholders involved; communication can be easily facilitated; yet mediation using an indicator tool led to frustration.

       " 'While land reclaimed from the sea meets the land demand for coastal development, it simultaneously causes socio-economic systems to be prone to coastal flooding induced by storm surges and sea-level rise. Current studies have seldom linked reclamation with coastal flood impact assessment, hindering the provision of accurate information to support coastal flood risk management and adaptation. This study, using Xiamen, China as a case study, incorporates the spatiotemporal dynamics of reclamation into a coastal flood impact model, in order to investigate the long-term influence of reclamation activities on coastal flood inundation and the consequent exposure of the population to coastal flooding. We find that rapid population growth, continual economic development and urbanization drive a substantial logarithmic increase in coastal reclamation. Historical and future expansions of seaward land reclamation are found to cause dramatic surges in the expected annual inundation (EAI) and the expected annual population (EAP) exposed to coastal flooding. In Xiamen, EAI is estimated to increase by 440.2% from 1947 to 2035, owing to continuing land reclamation. Consequently, the population living in the flooded area has also increased sharply: the EAP of total population is estimated to rise from 0.8% in 1947 to 4.7% in 2035, where reclamation contributes over 80% of this increase. Moreover, a future 10 cm sea-level rise in 2035 will lead to extra 5.73% and 8.15% increases in EAI and EAP, respectively, and is expected to cause massive permanent submersion in the new reclamation zone.

This study analysed the impact of land use change due to urbanisation on surface runoff, using the geographic information system (GIS)-based soil conservation service curve number (SCS–CN) method, during the period of rapid urban development from 1980 to 2015 in Xiamen, located in south-eastern China. Land use change was analysed from the data obtained by classifying Landsat images from 1980, 1990, 2005, and 2015. Results indicated that farmland decreased the most by 14.01%, while built-up areas increased the most by 15.7%, from 1980 to 2015. Surface runoff was simulated using the GIS-based SCS–CN method for the rainfall return periods of 5, 10, 20, and 50 years. The spatial and temporal variation of runoff was obtained for each land use period. Results indicate that the increase in surface runoff was highest in the period of 1990–2005, with an increase of 10.63%. The effect of urbanisation can be realised from the amount of runoff, contributed by built-up land use type in the study area, that increased from 14.2% to 27.9% with the rise of urban expansion from 1980 to 2015. The relationship between land use and surface runoff showed that the rapid increase in constructed land has significantly influenced the surface runoff of the area. Therefore, the introduction of nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure could be a potential solution for runoff mitigation and reducing urban flood risks in the context of increasing urbanization. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Coastal habitats have faced decades of loss caused by urbanization. Global recognition of the ecosystem services that coastal habitats provide has led to an emphasis on cities to adopt nature-based solutions (NBS). However, a broad assessment of urban areas and their potential to conserve remaining coastal habitat has not been undertaken. Here we apply spatial analytics to investigate 5,096 coastal urban areas in tropical and subtropical regions within the distribution of mangroves, tidal flats, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs, and find <50% of urban areas have natural coastal habitats within their extent. Large conservation opportunities for urban areas exist within an adjacent 50 km buffer zone where a significant proportion (93%) of urban-influenced coastal habitat lies and where 26% is currently protected. Potential high-conservation areas across the globe provide a unique opportunity to increase the resilience of urbanizing coasts and NBS for long-term socioeconomic and conservation goals. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.',\n",
       " 'A Monviso clone has been applied to promote PCB degradation in a soil historically contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals (HMs). The multi-contaminated area is located in Southern Italy. PCBs, HMs, and the soil microbial community (abundance, viability, and structure) were analysed in selected plots of the poplar-treated area. At 900 days after poplar planting, chemical analyses showed that PCBs and most of HMs diminished under the Italian legal limits. The overall results suggest that the poplar clone was effective in promoting PCB rhizodegradation and HM phytostabilization. Organic carbon content increased strongly in the rhizosphere of the planted plots. Microbiological results highlighted an overall increase in microbial abundance, cell viability, and the presence of bacterial groups involved in PCB degradation. The poplar-based bioremediation technology is a nature-based solution able to promote the recovery of soil quality in terms of contaminant removal, increase in organic carbon, and stimulation of autochthonous bacterial groups able to transform PCBs. © 2021 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'The concept of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) has emerged to foster sustainable development by transversally addressing social, economic, and environmental urban challenges. However, there is still a considerable lack of agreement on the conceptualization of NBS, especially concerning typologies, nomenclature, and performance assessments in terms of ecosystem services (ES) and urban challenges (UC). Therefore, this article consolidates the knowledge from 4 European projects to set a path for a common understanding of NBS and thus, facilitate their mainstreaming. To do so, firstly, we performed elicitation workshops to develop an integrative list of NBS, based on the identification of overlaps among NBS from different projects. The terminologies were formalized via web-based surveys. Secondly, the NBS were clustered, following a conceptual hierarchical classification. Thirdly, we developed an integrative assessment of NBS performance (ES and UC) based on the qualitative evaluations from each project. Afterwards, we run a PCA and calculated the evenness index to explore patterns among NBS. The main conceptual advancement resides in providing a list of 32 NBS and putting forward two novel NBS categories: NBS units (NBSu) that are stand-alone green technologies or green urban spaces, which can be combined with other solutions (nature-based or not); NBS interventions (NBSi) that refer to the act of intervening in existing ecosystems and in NBSu, by applying techniques to support natural processes. The statistical analysis suggests that NBSu are more versatile than NBSi in terms of UC and ES. Moreover, the results of the integrative assessment of NBS performance suggest a greater agreement concerning the role of NBS in addressing environmental UC, cultural and regulating ES than regarding socio-economic UC and supporting and provision ES. Finally, the ‘green factor’ and the replication of non-intensive practices occurring in nature seem to be key criteria for practitioners to identify a particular solution as an NBS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Passing of pharmaceutical residues into environment in an uncontrolled manner as a result of continuous increase in drug consumption across the globe has become a threatening problem for the ecosystems and almost all living creatures. In this study, diclofenac (DCF), carbamazepine (CBZ), 17β-estradiol (17β-E2) and 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) belonging to different therapeutic classes were investigated simultaneously in advanced biological treatment and nature-based treatments during 12-months sampling campaign. In this context, behavior patterns of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) throughout the both wastewater and sludge lines in advanced biological wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), wastewater stabilization pond (WSP) and constructed wetland (CW) were discussed in detail based on each treatment processes seasonally. Furthermore, statistically evaluated data obtained in full-scale WWTPs were compared with each other in order to determine the valid removal mechanisms of these pharmaceutical compounds. While DCF and CBZ were detected very intensively both in the wastewater and sludge lines of the investigated WWTPs, steroid hormones,17β-E2 and EE2, were determined below the LOQ value in general. Annual average removal efficiencies achieved in studied WWTPs for DCF ranged between −23.3% (in CW) and 75.2% (in WSP), while annual average removal rates obtained for CBZ varied between −20.7% (in advanced biological treatment) and 10.0% (in CW). It has been found that DCF was highly affected by different wastewater treatment processes applied in the WWTPs compared to CBZ which showed extraordinary resistance to all different treatment processes. Although calculated in different rates for each compounds, biodegradation/biotransformation and sorption onto sewage sludge were determined as the main removal mechanisms for PhACs in plants. Although showed a similar behavior in the sludge dewatering unit (decanter) present in the advanced biological WWTP, quite different behaviors observed in the anaerobic digester for DCF (up to 15% decrease) and CBZ (up to 95% increase). Sorption and desorption behaviors of DCF and CBZ were also evaluated in the sludge treatment processes found in advanced biological WWTP. Percentages of originated extra annual average of pharmaceutical loads were calculated as 0.64% and 0.90% for DCF and CBZ, respectively in the advanced biological WWTP due to the sidestream caused by the sludge dewatering unit. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Soil erosion is a threat for the sustainability of agriculture and severely affects the Mediterranean crops. Olive groves are among the rainfed agriculture lands that exhibit soil and water losses due to the impact of unsustainable practices such as conventional tillage and herbicides abuse. To achieve a more sustainable olive oil production, alternative, greener crop management practices need to be tested in the field. Here, a weed cover (CW) treatment is tested at an olive tree plantation that has undergone conventional mechanical tillage for 20 years and results were compared against an adjacent control plantation that maintained tillage as a weed control strategy (CO). Both plantations were under the same tillage management for centuries and macroscopic analysis confirms they are otherwise comparable. Compared to the CO, where tilled soil cover was zero, 20 years of CW (weeds cover 64%; litter cover 5%) had led to significantly higher values of soil bulk density and soil organic matter. Results from rainfall simulation experiments at 55 mm h−1 on 0.25 m2 plots under CO (N = 25) and CW (N = 25) show that as a result of the improved soil structure, CW (i) reduced soil losses by two orders of magnitude (140 times), (ii) decreased runoff yield by one order of magnitude (from 2.65 till 27.6% of the rainfall), (iii) significantly reduced runoff sediment concentration (from 18.6 till 1.43 g l−1), and (iv) significantly delayed runoff generation (CO = 273 s; CW = 788 s). These results indicate that weed cover is a sustainable land management practice in Mediterranean olive groves and promotes sustainable agriculture production in mountainous areas under rainfed conditions, which are typically affected by high erosion rates such those found in the CO plots. Due to the spontaneous recovery of plant cover, we conclude that weed cover is an excellent nature-based solution to increase in the soil organic matter content and soil erosion reduction in rainfed olive orchards. © 2021',\n",
       " 'There is a growing interest worldwide on the potential of nature-based solutions (NBSs) as measures for dealing with water-related risks while producing multiple co-benefits that can contribute to several societal challenges and many of the sustainable development goals. However, several barriers still hamper their wider implementation, such as mainly the lack of stakeholders’ engagement and the limited integration of stakeholders’ knowledge throughout the phases of NBS design and implementation. This is a crucial aspect to guarantee that the multidimensional implications of NBSs are adequately understood and considered by decision-makers. Innovative methods and tools for improving NBS design and supporting decision-makers in overcoming the main barriers to implementation, ultimately enhancing their effectiveness, are therefore needed. The present work proposes a combined approach based on the integration of fuzzy cognitive maps, hydraulic modeling, and participatory Bayesian belief networks aiming to facilitate the stakeholders’ engagement and the knowledge integration process in NBS design and assessment. The approach was developed and implemented within the NAIAD project in the Lower Danube demo site, specifically oriented to support the process of the Potelu Wetland restoration. First, fuzzy cognitive maps are adopted as a problem structuring method for eliciting stakeholders’ risk perception and problem understanding, and for constructing a causal model describing the system as a whole, with specific attention to the expected role of the NBS in reducing flood risk and addressing the key local challenges. Second, hydraulic modeling is used to analyze the effect of extreme floods starting from the retrospective analysis of a specific event and to model the potential benefits of risk reduction measures. Last, a Bayesian belief network is used to support the model integration process and a scenario analysis with a user-friendly tool. The whole process can be replicated in other areas and is particularly suitable to support an active engagement of stakeholders (both institutional and not) in the process of NBS design and assessment. © Copyright © 2021 Scrieciu, Pagano, Coletta, Fratino and Giordano.',\n",
       " 'In recent years, nature-based solutions have been increasingly promoted as a climate change adaptation instrument, strongly advocated to be co-created. Achieving clear, coherent, and ambitious urban greening strategies, embedded in urban planning and developed in a co-creative, participatory and inclusive manner, is highly challenging within the EU enlargement context. In this article, such challenges are studied through two recent urban development initiatives in Belgrade, the Capital of Serbia: the first initiative focuses on planning the new Linear Park, within the framework of the CLEVER Cities Horizon 2020 project; the second initiative envisages the transformation of the privatised Avala Film Complex in the Košutnjak Urban Forest, primarily led by private interests but supported by the local authorities. The multiple-case study research method is applied, with an exploratory purpose and as a basis for potential future research on evaluation of co-creation processes for NBS implementation. The theoretical basis of this article is founded in the research on sustainability transitions, focusing on multi-level perspective (MLP) framework. The urban planning system in Belgrade and Serbia is observed as a socio-technical regime of the MLP. In such framework, we recognize co-creative planning of the Linear Park as a niche innovation. We interpret opposition towards planning of the Avala Film Complex as escalation, or an extreme element of the socio-technical landscape, comprised of civic unrests and political tensions on one side, combined with the climate crisis and excessive pollution on the other side. Moreover, the article examines informal urban planning instruments that can be implemented by the practitioners of niche innovations, that could support urban planners and NBS advocates in the Serbian and EU enlargement contexts to face the challenges of motivating all stakeholders to proactively, constructively and appropriately engage in co-creation. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'This study provides insights into dune toe growth around and between individual brushwood lines of sand trapping fences at the dune toe of coastal dunes using digital elevation models obtained from repeated unmanned aerial vehicle surveys. Prevailing boundary conditions, especially sediment supply, as well as the porosity and arrangement of the installed sand trapping fences significantly influence the effectiveness of different configurations of sand trapping fences. The dune toe growth is significant immediately after constructing a new sand trapping fence and decreases over time. According to the results presented in this study, for sand trapping fences that have been in place longer, the protruding branch height and the porosity of the remaining branches play a minor role in trapping sand. Sand trapping fences with lower permeability favour localized coastal dune toe growth directly at their brushwood lines, whereas fences with higher porosity allow for more sediment deposition further downwind. The trend in dune toe changes can be roughly predicted by integrating potential sediment transport rates calculated with hourly meteorological data. © 2021 by the authors.

Conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of the habitat, given that its change is the most prominent factor causing the deterioration of biodiversity, represents a highly effective way of securing biodiversity. Therefore, we assessed and monitored habitat quality as a proxy for biodiversity with habitat quantity in Jeju Island, South Korea. We used an InVEST model with data on the habitat type, suitability, sensitivity, accessibility, and threat factors. Natural habitats throughout Jeju had rapidly decreased in area by 24.9% from 1989 to 2019, and this change contributed to the degradation of habitat quality by 15.8%. We provided significant evidence on the critical degradation of habitat for a long period of over 30 years and highlighted the urgent need for policies and behaviors that enhance biodiversity. We proposed appropriate strategies to prompt people to conserve better, restore effectively, and use biodiversity sustainably. We expect that our findings will provide scientific and evidence-based guidance for policy-making on biodiversity enhancement and will further support achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and Aichi Biodiversity Targets, in addition to compliance with the New Deal for Nature and People. © 2021 by the authors.

The WS&H systems follow the approaches of integrated water resource management, nature-based solutions and the recovery of ancestral knowledge for water management. In this paper, we present some representative types of WS&H in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal, and then, we focus on the Paltas Catacocha Ecohydrology Demonstration Site in southern Ecuador as a study case. The recovery of such local ecohydrological knowledge in the study case has made enabled the regulation and retention of water in the aquifers through the restoration of artificial wetlands (cochas) and stream dams (tapes or tajamares). Also, this ancestral way of water management has recently supported and reactivated several biological aspects and human activities.

       " 'There has been a recent surge of interest in Nature-based Solutions, a concept encompassing a broad suite of ideas that have arisen from the intersection of ecology, engineering, sociology and economics. Solutions founded in nature are promised to resolve many issues resulting from global change, including reducing flood risk and air pollution, building social cohesion and enhancing resilience. However, what a Nature-based Solution means in practice remains unstructured and vaguely defined. Specifically, what is meant by Nature-based is not well defined and there has been little effort to rigorously understand how a solution is created. In response, we propose an integrated conceptual framework, extending the service-benefit relationship to include solutions, while acknowledging that multiple types of service exist (ecosystem services, technological services and labour). We present a method to measure the degree to which a solution is Nature-based: calculate the relative contribution of ecosystem services, compared with technological services and labour. The method and framework are applied to projects dealing with problems related to water pollution, demonstrating their applicability. The framework can be a useful tool to guide environmental managers in identifying both the scale and context at which, and the problems to which, Nature-based Solutions are applicable. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",

By the end of 2019, 25 pilot projects for ecosystem conservation and restoration had been carried out in China. Although the previous efforts had achieved some results, there are still many problems, such as unclear conservation and restoration goals, insufficient scientific characterization, excessive engineering measures, lack of dynamic monitoring and evaluation, and difficulty in realizing harmonious coexistence between human and nature. In the current research, we built a four-level-regional (province), landscape, ecosystem and subproject level-technical framework for ecosystem conservation and restoration, based on the theories in landscape and restoration ecology and the concepts of nature-based solution, adaptive management, complex socio-economic-natural ecosystem, and ecosystem services. Under this framework, the technical requirements related to monitoring and managing the entire project implementation process were proposed, so as to provide the theoretical and technical supports toward integrated conservation, systematic restoration, and comprehensive management of a full range of ecosystems. © 2021, Editorial Office of Earth Science Frontiers.

As one of the most accepted measures addressing societal challenges, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have developed rapidly, with emerging concepts, principles and practices. This paper systematically sorts out the concepts, core theories and typical cases of NbS, and interprets, from the perspective of NbS, the problems in the pilot projects in terms of their spatio-temporal scale, goal setting, technical measures, and implementation and management strategies. We propose using NbS as reference to improve the ecosystem protection and restoration projects in China, which entails adopting a multi-scale, multi-objective design, setting multi-objective goals, and establishing a scientific technical framework and standard.

       " 'Vertical greenery systems (VGS) are promoted as a nature-based solution to mitigate the urban heat island effect. In order to ensure the long-term provision of this function, sufficiently available irrigation water is the key element. Currently, potable water is one of the main resources for irrigation of VGS. While rainwater is often mentioned as an alternative, only a few studies investigate the actual application of rainwater for irrigation. In this study a conceptual model is developed to present the processes and influencing factors for a holistic investigation of rainwater use for irrigation. In this model, five sub-modules are identified: the atmospheric, hydraulic, quality, rainwater harvesting and VGS sub-module. The conceptual model depicts which processes and influencing factors are involved in the water demand of VGS. Thus, the conceptual model supports a holistic understanding of the interrelations between the identified sub-modules and their relevance for VGS irrigation with harvested rainwater. The results of this study support the implementation of rainwater harvesting as a sustainable resource for VGS irrigation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Based on historical and WFD-compliant data, the recent inter-annual ecological status and the long-term chemical-physicochemical quality trends of eighteen characteristic Greek rivers have been assessed and interpreted in view of implementing EU environmental policies and the evolution of human pressures. Considering predominating poor ecological status in most of the river outflows, the strengths and weaknesses of the WFD implementation have been highlighted. The long-term decrease of ammonium and nitrite concentrations along with relatively low recent BOD5 levels, indicate a general improvement of WWTP infrastructure in Greece and the other riparian countries, whereas the improvement of nitrate quality is attributed to the reduction of fertilizers use, and possibly, to the successful application of the Nitrates Directive in certain basins. Despite capac-ity building in governance and administrative infrastructure the recent years, River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) are being implemented centrally, largely mechanistically, with minor public participation. Regarding WFD implementation weaknesses and gaps, concrete proposals have been formulated considering both policy/administrative and technical issues. To efficiently conserve and restore aquatic ecosystems, the forthcoming RBMPs should be consistent with ecosystem services principles focusing on nature-based solutions, along with changing attitudes of the state authorities and the public. © 2021 by the authors.

       " \"As storm-driven coastal flooding increases under climate change, wetlands such as saltmarshes are held as a nature-based solution. Yet evidence supporting wetlands' storm protection role in estuaries - where both waves and upstream surge drive coastal flooding - remains scarce. Here we address this gap using numerical hydrodynamic models within eight contextually diverse estuaries, simulating storms of varying intensity and coupling flood predictions to damage valuation. Saltmarshes reduced flooding across all studied estuaries and particularly for the largest - 100 year - storms, for which they mitigated average flood extents by 35% and damages by 37% ($8.4 M). Across all storm scenarios, wetlands delivered mean annual damage savings of $2.7 M per estuary, exceeding annualised values of better studied wetland services such as carbon storage. Spatial decomposition of processes revealed flood mitigation arose from both localised wave attenuation and estuary-scale surge attenuation, with the latter process dominating: mean flood reductions were 17% in the sheltered top third of estuaries, compared to 8% near wave-exposed estuary mouths. Saltmarshes therefore play a generalised role in mitigating storm flooding and associated costs in estuaries via multi-scale processes. Ecosystem service modelling must integrate processes operating across scales or risk grossly underestimating the value of nature-based solutions to the growing threat of storm-driven coastal flooding. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'Implementing nature-based solutions (NBSs) in cities, such as urban forests, can have multiple effects on the quality of life of inhabitants, acting on the mitigation of climate change, and in some cases also enhancing citizens’ social life and the transformation of customer patterns in commercial activities. Assessing this latter effect is the aim of this paper. An agent-based model (ABM) was used to assess change in commercial activities by small and midsize companies in retail due to the development of parks. The paper focuses on the potential capacity of NBS green spaces to boost retail companies’ business volumes, thus increasing their revenues, and at the same time create a pleasant feeling of space usability for the population. The type of NBS is not specified but generalized into large green spaces. The simulation contains two types of agents: (1) residents and (2) shop owners. Factors that attract new retail shops to be established in an area are simplified, based on attractor points, which identify areas such as large green spaces within and around which shops can form. The simulations provided insights on the number of retail shops that can be sustained based on the purchasing behavior of citizens that walk in parks. Four European cities were explored: Szeged (Hungary), Alcalá de Henares (Spain), Çankaya Municipality (Turkey) and Milan (Italy). The model allowed analyzing the indirect economic benefit of NBSs (i.e., large green spaces in this case) on a neighborhood’s economic structure. More precisely, the presence of green parks in the model boosted the visits of customers to local small shops located within and around them, such as cafés and kiosks, allowing for the emergence of 5–6 retail shops (on average, for about 800 walking citizens) in the case of Szeged and an average 12–14 retail shops for a simulated population of 2900 persons that walk in parks in the case of Milan. Overall, results from this modeling exercise can be considered representative for large urban green areas usually visited by a substantial number of citizens. However, their pertinence to support for local policies for NBS implementation and other decision-making related activities of socioeconomic nature is hampered by the low representativeness of source data used for the simulations. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer multiple solutions to urban challenges simultaneously, but realising funding for NBS remains a challenge. When the concept of NBS for societal challenges was first defined by the EC in 2017, financing was recognised as one of the major challenges to its mainstreaming. The complexity of NBS finance has its origin in the multiple benefits/stakeholders involved, which obscures the argument for both public and private sector investment. Since 2017, subsequent waves of EU research-and innovation-funded projects have substantially contributed to the knowledge base of funding and business models for NBS, particularly in the urban context. Collaborating and sharing knowledge through an EU Task Force, this first set of EU projects laid important knowledge foundations, reviewing existing literature, and compiling empirical evidence of different financing approaches and the business models that underpinned them. The second set of EU innovation actions advanced this knowledge base, developing and testing new implementation models, business model tools, and approaches. This paper presents the findings of these projects from a business model perspective to improve our understanding of the value propositions of NBS to support their mainstreaming. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions can represent beneficial tools in the field of urban transformation for their contribution to important environmental services such as air quality improvement. To evaluate the impact on urban air pollution of a CityTree (CT), an innovative wall-type green infrastructure in passive (deposition) and active (filtration) modes of operation, a study was conducted in a real urban setting in Modena (Italy) during 2017 and 2018, combining experimental measurements with modelling system evaluations. In this work, relying on the computational resources of CRESCO (Computational Centre for Research on Complex Systems)/ENEAGRID High Performance Computing infrastructure, we used the air pollution microscale model PMSS (Parallel Micro-SWIFT-Micro SPRAY) to simulate air quality during the experimental campaigns. The spatial characteristics of the impact of the CT on local air pollutants concentrations, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM10), were assessed. In particular, we used prescribed bulk deposition velocities provided by the experimental campaigns, which tested the CT both in passive (deposition) and in active (filtration) mode of operation. Our results showed that the PM10 and NOx concentration reductions reach from more than 0.1% up to about 0.8% within an area of 10 × 20 m2 around the infrastructure, when the green infrastructure operates in passive mode. In filtration mode the CT exhibited higher performances in the abatement of PM10 concentrations (between 1.5% and 15%), within approximately the same area. We conclude that CTs may find an application in air quality hotspots within specific urban settings (i.e., urban street canyons) where a very localized reduction of pollutants concentration during rush hours might be of interest to limit population exposure. The optimization of the spatial arrangement of CT modules to increment the “clean air zone” is a factor to be investigated in the ongoing development of the CT technology. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The increased frequency of extreme rain events due to climate change has garnered attention in Japan. In 2018, the country enacted the Act of Climate Change Adaptation to formulate plans at national and local levels. The government has suggested the use of nature-based solutions (NBSs) across the country to address the increased risk of natural disasters. This study employs scenario analysis to examine the effectiveness of NBSs for the mitigation of flood risk and their implications on the provision of ecosystem services (ESs). Shiga prefecture in Japan enacted its own ordinance in 2015. This ordinance considers existing land use and building regulations to mitigate flood risk. The quantitative analysis assumes nine scenarios up to the year 2050, combining the current policy of Shiga and our original assumption of advance policy options to evaluate the future flood risk and ES. The analysis revealed that land use management can partially mitigate the flood risk by banning new residences and relocating residential land from flood-prone areas to safer areas and converting residential land into forest and paddy fields. It also suggests that both flood risk mitigation and provision of ESs can be further improved if local governments introduce a residence growth management strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Biodiversity within cities is fundamental for human health and well-being, and delivers a wide range of critical ecosystem services. However, biodiversity is often viewed as an afterthought or final addition once an urban development nears completion. As such, provisions for biodiversity are typically tokenistic and do not achieve the experience of everyday nature that people need. Considering biodiversity requirements at the start of an urban development allows for strategic, intentional design with biodiversity enhancement in mind. Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) is a protocol that aims to create urban areas that deliver on-site benefit to native species and ecosystems through the provision of essential habitat and food resources. Here we present a case study demonstrating how BSUD methods can be used to (a) encourage successful outcomes for nature, (b) improve the aesthetics and liveability of the urban form, and (c) engage stakeholders in a process that supports other aspects of urban design including park and streetscape design. Fishermans Bend (Melbourne) is the largest urban renewal project in Australia, and one of the first of this scale to explicitly include biodiversity targets. We outline the methods used to co-create biodiversity objectives with diverse stakeholders, and how these, combined with a quantitative analysis of their potential biodiversity impact, were translated into clear design and planning recommendations. We critically reflect on the success of this method for 1) communicating and facilitating provisions for biodiversity across different stakeholders and 2) providing clear messaging around biodiversity across different planning disciplines. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Urbanisation, population growth and climate change, among other challenges, have put pressure on urban infrastructure systems, prompting a shift from large-scale centralised infrastructure to localised nature-based solutions. Mainstreaming nature-based solutions requires a change in the planning and governance systems, and mediating new relationships and configurations between different actors through collaborative governance. Yet, limited guidance exists on how to design collaborative governance for delivering nature-based solutions. This has led to collaboration processes that are established on an ad-hoc basis, relying on the experiences, skills and viewpoints of their champions to endure. This paper synthesises and extends a suite of theoretical frameworks with the practice-based knowledge of urban practitioners across Australia (n = 42), to develop a framework for designing collaborative governance. The framework offers key principles and considerations for designing collaborations on nature-based solutions. It emphasises upfront planning that carefully considers the desired outcomes (the ‘why’), assesses the operating environment/context (the ‘what’), engages the right actors at the required level of influence (the ‘who’), and uses fit-for-purpose structures and process for interaction (the ‘how’). The framework also highlights that all those elements need to be considered with the intended level of impact in mind. To illustrate the application of our framework, we will use empirical examples from major urban development programs across Australia that have adopted water sensitive urban design (as part of the broader family of nature-based solutions) through cross-sectoral collaborations. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " \"Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have been an increasingly recognized framework that uses naturally occurring processes to maximise the provisioning of ecosystem services and improve the life quality of city dwellers. One of the more widely applied NbS is an intentional abandonment of green space cultivation and promoting wilderness. In this study, we developed urban spontaneous vegetation (USV) identification algorithm based on NDVI from Sentinel-2 data in Warsaw's green spaces, Poland. We verified the study in an on-site survey where we collected 2863 field reference plots for USV and cultivated vegetation identification. We achieved 74 % accuracy for USV and 70 % for cultivated vegetation identification. The study assessed the spatial resources and extent of USV in the scale of the city and within various types of urban greenery. We identified the vegetation development persistence over 3 years and assessed the spontaneity levels of urban greenery. Classification of Warsaw's vegetation revealed that 54 % of Warsaw's greenery is cultivated while the remaining part is characterized by various levels of spontaneity. Only in 34.7 % of USV, we found no interruption of vegetation development due to cultivation for at least 3 years.

       " 'As urbanization increases worldwide, investments in nature-based solutions that aim to mitigate urban stressors and counter the impacts of global climate change are also on the rise. Tree planting on degraded urban lands—or afforestation—is one form of nature-based solution that has been increasingly implemented in cities around the world. The benefits of afforestation are, however, contingent on the capacity of soils to support the growth of planted trees, which poses a challenge in some urban settings where unfavorable soil conditions limit tree performance. Soil-focused site treatments could help urban areas overcome impediments to afforestation, yet few studies have examined the long-term (>5\\xa0yr) effects of site treatments on soils and other management objectives. We analyzed the impacts of compost amendments, interplanting with shrubs, and tree species composition (six species vs. two species) on soil conditions and associated tree growth in 54 experimental afforestation plots in New York City, USA. We compared baseline soil conditions to conditions after 6 yr and examined changes in the treatment effects from 1 to 6 yr. Site treatments and tree planting increased soil microbial biomass, water holding capacity, and total carbon and nitrogen, and reduced soil pH and bulk density relative to baseline conditions. These changes were most pronounced in compost-amended plots, and the effects of the shrub and species composition treatments were minimal. In fact, compost was key to sustaining long-term changes in soil carbon stocks, which increased by 17% in compost-amended plots but declined in unamended plots. Plots amended with compost also had 59% more nitrogen than unamended plots, which was associated with a 20% increase in the basal area of planted trees. Improvements in soil conditions after 6 yr departed from the initial trends observed after 1 yr, highlighting the importance of longer-term studies to quantify restoration success. Altogether, our results show that site treatments and tree planting can have long-lasting impacts on soil conditions and that these changes can support multiple urban land management objectives. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America',\n",
       " 'The control of air pollution remains a challenge to the planning of cities and fossil fuel burning is the main cause of air degradation. Particulate matter (PM) is the contaminant commonly used as an indicator of pollution, but environmental agencies may face difficulties in operating surveillance networks due to the lack of resources and infrastructure. As an alternative to conventional networks, scientific studies have pointed out that nature itself can contribute to the diagnosis and reduction of air pollution. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are proposals that use natural processes and structures to meet different environmental challenges. In this study, biomonitoring with\\xa0Tillandsia usneoides was applied as a NbS tool to evaluate air quality in an important port urban area in the city of Guarujá, Brazil, affected by industrial and vehicular emissions. It was observed that cadmium mass fractions were at least forty times higher than the control area with one-month exposition. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " \"Urban areas face multiple environmental challenges that interact with climate change, including the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Plants can be a nature-based solution for UHI-effect mitigation, alongside various artificial materials, but their performance is only commonly compared to concrete or asphalt. Given shade's ubiquity in the urban environment, it also has a strong potential to interact with and change urban spaces' thermal performances but is rarely included in plant UHI effect-mitigation analyses. We completed an experiment to record the UHI effect-mitigation potential of 10 plant species (turf grasses, shrubs and climber/creeper plants) and eight materials (including three with high albedo) with and without shade on a rooftop in tropical Singapore across multiple sunny days in May and June 2018. We explained the infrared thermography-recorded surface temperatures of plants and materials with a surface type–time interaction in a linear regression model. Our model predicted that, without shade, except for concrete coated with white paint or infrared-reflecting white paint, plants' exterior surfaces were cooler than all artificial materials by at least ∼11 °C at 13:30 (the peak surface temperature of artificial materials). Unshaded plant species had comparable surface temperatures to shaded artificial materials and were marginally cooler than unshaded high-albedo materials. Shading caused no significant reduction of temperatures for nine of the 10 plant species studied. Our results suggest that high-albedo materials and plants can mitigate the UHI effect, either on the ground or as sources of shade to offset heat gain, and that planting up shaded surfaces would generate marginal additional cooling. Our findings should be integrated into broader trade-off analyses on the economic and health value of replacing unshaded artificial materials with plants, as UHI-effect mitigation is one of many ecosystem services provided by plants. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH\",\n",
       " 'In recent years, roof greening technologies have been developed and implemented worldwide, as green roofs are an effective nature-based solution for alleviating outdoor heat and reducing building energy costs. While most observational green roof studies have investigated the cooling effect of model or test plots, few studies have conducted full-scale measurements; however, to guide green roof implementation, the thermal performance of full-scale roofs is crucial. This experimental study explored the ability of extensive green roofs to reduce outdoor temperatures on multiple time scales. The outdoor cooling effect of green roofs and the main factors that drive its performance were analyzed using long-term observational data collected from May 2016 to April 2019 in Nanjing, China. The results suggest that the cooling effect of green roofs exhibits significant diurnal, seasonal, annual, and vertical trends, and that the cooling performance across different time scales corresponds to weather and soil characteristics. The best cooling effect occurred at a height of 60 cm. The green roof displayed a temporary diurnal warming effect but had a good cooling effect on a seasonal time scale, with the largest amount of cooling occurring during the summer (average of 0.28 °C). The findings of this study can support the development, management, and maintenance of green roofs in subtropical areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

       " 'Because of a decrease in water provision from the Yellow River and the influence of various human actions, the Shandong Yellow River Delta Wetland, selected a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2013, has undergone substantial degradation. Although some restoration work has been undertaken, more adaptive active restoration strategies should be developed based on researches on spontaneous revegetation in this region. In this regard, the quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs), characterized by a rapid rate of succession, are thus considered as ideal research targets. The spatial and temporal quantification of QVPs is not only fundamental to determining QVP formation mechanism but also contributes to the development of adaptive restoration strategies for the degraded ecosystems. Therefore, we examined QVP dynamics over seven time periods spanning 22 years using one aerial photograph and seven high-spatial resolution satellite images. We found that although the total number of QVPs remained almost unchanged, the total area had an increasing trend, and that the shape index ([Formula presented]) of QVPs tended to initially increase and subsequently decrease, with QVPs finally attaining an almost circular shape. Observations for the period between 2000 and 2016 indicated that the area and shape of QVPs could reach maximum extents within about three years. This knowledge could provide a valuable basis for studying the interactions of QVPs with environment, and the implications/consequences to ecosystems, e.g., mechanisms of the evolution of ecosystems, ecological services etc. We accordingly suggest that developing a long-term remote sensing monitoring and ground-based survey program would make a significant contribution to developing a nature-based solution for the degraded ecosystems in the Yellow River Delta, China. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'The current difficulties in determining the ecological flow of rivers in northern China are the poor pertinence of methods and insufficient consideration of ecological factors. On the basis of systematic analysis of river hydrological situations and ecological protection objectives, the existing water ecological problems in river reaches were identified, a nested calculation framework for ecological flow of rivers was given based on Nature-based Solutions (NbS), considering the ecological integrity, biological diversity, morphological diversity and ecological service functions. With help of physical habitat simulation and the Penman-Monteith formula, indicator species were selected to research the natural process of restoring river function and realizing river runoff. To meet the water requirements of riparian vegetation during the growth period of the indicated species, the water demand law of typical vegetation changing with the growth time was studied, the upper and lower water levels were set, and the ecological water requirements of vegetation at each growth stage were determined. The results showed that the ecological basic flows required for the spawning period (April-June), the juvenile period (July-November) and the growth period (December-March) of Pseudorasbora parva in the Long River (typical section) were 3.14 m3/s, 4.32 m3/s and 2.16 m3/s, respectively. At the end of the spawning period, a 7-day (90% guarantee rate) pulse flow with a peak flow of 11.31 m3/s, a small flood process with a peak flow of 24.95 m3/s and a small flood process in the flood season lasting for 3 days provided effective external stimulation for the spawning of Pseudorasbora parva. The minimum annual ecological water requirement of reed was 15,100 m3. The current ecological flow of the Long River can meet the water requirements of most aquatic organisms and plants in the river ecosystem. The ecological flow calculation method based on NbS is widely applicable, and the results are representative. The method can be used to calculate the ecological flow of small and medium-sized northern rivers with a small flow and low flow rate. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'In the context of earthquake risk, a vulnerability and resilience perspective has changed a purely technological orientation in facing natural hazards. One aspect of this change is the increasing awareness to include indigenous, traditional knowledge, community-based action, and local practices as well as experience from historic events in earthquake hazard management. Various research has shown that indigenous knowledge has an important role in avoiding undesired impacts from hazards. The involvement of indigenous knowledge into hazard management has been accepted as a fruitful approach by many countries. In Indonesia, the indigenous response to natural hazards, especially towards earthquakes, is to adapt the house constructions according to the hazards from their surrounding living environment and these have been tested and proven for many centuries. But while such indigenous knowledge has existed for centuries, learning requires more than just remembering, it needs to be translated into new actions. This paper highlights connections between knowing and acting on disasters, as manifested in house construction, and how this resonates with the concept of resilience. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " \"The emissions reduction pledges made by individual countries through the 2015 Paris Agreement represent the current global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the face of the enduring climate crisis. Natural lands carbon sequestration and storage are critical for successful pathways to global decarbonization (i.e., as a negative emissions technology). Coastal vegetated habitats maintain carbon sequestration rates exceeding forest sequestration rates on a per unit area basis by nearly two orders of magnitude. These blue carbon habitats and their associated carbon sequestration benefits are vulnerable to losses from land-use change and sea-level rise. Incorporation of blue carbon habitats in climate change policy is one strategy for both maintaining these habitats and conserving significant carbon sequestration capabilities. Previous policy assessments have found the potential for incorporation of coastal carbon sequestration in national-level policies, yet there has – to date – been little inclusion of blue carbon in the national-scale implementation of Paris commitments. Recently, sub-national jurisdictions have gained attention as models for pathways to decarbonization. However, few previous studies have examined sub-national level policy opportunities for operationalizing blue carbon into climate decision-making. California is uniquely poised to integrate benefits from blue carbon into its coastal planning and management and its suite of climate mitigation policies. Here, we evaluated legal authorities and policy contexts addressing sequestration specifically from blue carbon habitats. We synthesized the progressive action in California's approaches to mitigate carbon emissions including statutory, regulatory, and non-regulatory opportunities to incorporate blue carbon ecosystem service information into state- and local-level management decisions. To illustrate how actionable blue carbon information can be produced for use in decision-making, we conducted a spatial analysis of blue carbon sequestration in several locations in California across multiple agencies and management contexts. We found that the average market values of carbon sequestration services in 2100 ranged from $7,730 to $44,000 per hectare and that the social cost of carbon sequestration value was 1.3 to 2.7 times the market value. We also demonstrated that restoration of small areas with high sequestration rates can be comparable to the sequestration of existing marshes. Our results illustrate how accessible information about carbon sequestration in coastal habitats can be directly incorporated into existing policy frameworks at the sub-national scale. The incorporation of blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national climate policies can serve as a model for the development of future policy approaches for negative emissions technologies, with consequences for the success of the Paris Agreement and science-based decarbonization by mid-century. © 2020\",\n",
       " 'Spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly being used to inform urban green infrastructure planning. We explore the use of modern cloud computing technologies (Google Earth Engine) to facilitate public access to spatial MCDA of ecosystem services from green infrastructure. Using the spatial prioritization of green roof retrofitting in Oslo, Norway, as a case study, we present a web application that is a generalizable tool for engaging stakeholders in spatial planning of ecosystem restoration and nature-based solutions. In our application, green roof designers, owners and operators identified the relative importance of a suite of potential ecosystem services (ES) gained from retrofitting of green roofs, conditional on preference profiles expected by users of different building functional types. The ES assessed included temperature regulation, stormwater runoff mitigation, habitat for biodiversity, aesthetic value, and noise reduction. In Oslo we found high spatial correlation in ES deficits, implying that even large differences in stakeholder preferences for individual ES will lead MCDA to identify common interests in the spatial targeting of green roofs. Nevertheless, we found the interactive spatial MCDA web application to have potential for improving planning process efficiency in engaging stakeholders. In more heterogenous urban landscapes, with lower spatial correlation of individual ES, spatial MCDA also has scope to improve the output efficiency of spatial targeting of nature-based solutions such as green roofs.

However, investment within the BE has been slowed by the lack of a sufficiently robust operational definition. This lack of definition reduces investor confidence and impacts adoption by policy makers and practitioners. By considering the overlap between the two sustainability frameworks it is possible to identify specific sectors and activities within the BE that also fit the operationalised criteria for NbS. Undertaking this process for one sector of the BE (aquaculture) has provided evidence that aquaculture activities, if planned and operated within the criteria, would qualify as NbS and as such may unlock financing for the provision of ecosystem services. © Copyright © 2021 Hughes.',\n",
       " 'Climate change is one factor increasing the risk of hydro-meteorological hazards globally. The use of nature-based solutions (NbS), and more specifically ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction measures (Eco-DRR), has become a popular response for risk reduction that also provides highly-valued co-benefits. Public acceptance is of particular importance for NbS since they often rely on local collaborative implementation, management, and monitoring, as well as long-term protection against competing societal interests. Although public engagement is a common goal of NbS projects, it is rarely carried out with a sufficient understanding of the (de)motivating factors tied to public perceptions. Successful collaboration demands consideration of societal attitudes and values in relation to risk, nature, and place. However, existing research does not sufficiently explore these themes together, their interactions, and their implications for the public acceptance of NbS. This may lead to misaligned public expectations and failed participatory initiatives, while jeopardizing the success of NbS projects and their continued funding and uptake. We conducted citizen surveys within local NbS “host” communities to determine the degree of pro-NbS attitudes and behavior, associated variables, and how these may be leveraged to increase acceptance. We compared results across sites, relying primarily on correlations and regression models along with survey comments and expert knowledge. Three distinct rural NbS being implemented within the OPERANDUM project aim to reduce risk from (socio-)natural hazards in Scotland (landslides and coastal erosion; n = 66 respondents), Finland (eutrophication and algal blooms; n = 204) and Greece (river flooding and water scarcity; n = 84). Our research thus centers on rural NbS for risk reduction within a large EU project. Trust in implementers is a consistent factor for defining attitudes towards the NbS across the sites, and attitudes are strongly associated with respondents’ commitment to nature and behavioral acceptance (i.e., willingness to engage). Behaviorial acceptance is most consistently predicted by connectedness to place and the extent of expected future impacts. Skepticism of NbS effectiveness leads to high public demand for relevant evidence. To increase public acceptance, we recommend greater framing of NbS in relation to place-based values as well as demonstration of the effectiveness of NbS for risk reduction. However, distinct hazard types, proposed NbS, and historical characteristics must be considered for developing strategies aimed at increasing acceptance. An understanding of these characteristics and their interactions leads to evidence-based recommendations for our study sites and for successful NbS deployment in Europe and beyond. © Copyright © 2021 Anderson, Renaud, Hanscomb, Munro, Gonzalez-Ollauri, Thomson, Pouta, Soini, Loupis, Panga and Stefanopoulou.',\n",
       " \"This work evaluated the removal efficiency of 13 wastewater-borne pharmaceuticals in a pilot constructed wetland (CW) operated under different aeration strategies (no aeration, intermittent and continuous). Aeration improved the removal of conventional wastewater parameters and the targeted micropollutants, compared to the non-aerated treatment. Reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) was slightly higher applying intermittent aeration than applying continuous aeration, the opposite was observed for the investigated pharmaceuticals. Seven targeted compounds were found in influent wastewater, and five of them (acetaminophen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil) were efficiently removed (> 83%) in the aerated systems. The overall risk of the investigated samples against aquatic ecosystems was moderate, decreasing in the order influent > no aeration > intermittent aeration > continuous aeration, based on the hazard quotient approach. Lorazepam, diclofenac and ketoprofen were the pharmaceuticals that could contribute the most to this potential environmental impact of the CW effluents after discharge.

       " 'Conventional wastewater treatment technologies are costly and energy demanding; such issues are especially remarkable when small communities have to clean up their pollutants. In response to these requirements, a new variety of nature-based solution, so-called METland®, has been recently develop by using concepts from Microbial Electrochemical Technologies (MET) to outperform classical constructed wetland regarding wastewater treatment. Thus, the current study evaluates two operation modes (aerobic and aerobic–anoxic) of a full-scale METland®, including a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) conducted under a Net Environmental Balance perspective. Moreover, a combined technical and environmental analysis using a Net Eutrophication Balance (NEuB) focus concluded that the downflow (aerobic) mode achieved the highest removal rates for both organic pollutant and nitrogen, and it was revealed as the most environmentally friendly design. Actually, aerobic configuration outperformed anaero/aero-mixed mode in a fold-range from 9 to 30%. LCA was indeed recalculated under diverse Functional Units (FU) to determine the influence of each FU in the impacts. Furthermore, in comparison with constructed wetland, METland® showed a remarkable increase in wastewater treatment capacity per surface area (0.6 m2/pe) without using external energy. Specifically, these results suggest that aerobic–anoxic configuration could be more environmentally friendly under specific situations where high N removal is required. The removal rates achieved demonstrated a robust adaptation to influent variations, revealing a removal average of 92% of Biology Oxygen Demand (BOD), 90% of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 40% of total nitrogen (TN), and 30% of total phosphorus (TP). Moreover, regarding the global warming category, the overall impact was 75% lower compared to other conventional treatments like activated sludge. In conclusion, the LCA revealed that METland® appears as ideal solution for rural areas, considering the low energy requirements and high efficiency to remove organic pollutants, nitrogen, and phosphates from urban wastewater. © Copyright © 2021 Peñacoba-Antona, Senán-Salinas, Aguirre-Sierra, Letón, Salas, García-Calvo and Esteve-Núñez.',\n",
       " 'Hydro-meteorological risks due to natural hazards such as severe floods, storm surges, landslides and droughts are causing impacts on different sectors of society. Such risks are expected to become worse given projected changes in climate, degradation of ecosystems, population growth and urbanisation. In this respect, nature-based solutions (NBSs) have emerged as effective means to respond to such challenges. A NBS is a term used for innovative solutions that are based on natural processes and ecosystems to solve different types of societal and environmental challenges. The present paper provides a critical review of the literature concerning NBSs for hydro-meteorological risk reduction and identifies current knowledge gaps and future research prospects. There has been a considerable growth of scientific publications on this topic, with a more significant rise taking place from 2007 onwards. Hence, the review process presented in this paper starts by sourcing 1608 articles from Scopus and 1431 articles from the Web of Science. The full analysis was performed on 146 articles. The analysis confirmed that numerous advancements in the area of NBSs have been achieved to date. These solutions have already proven to be valuable in providing sustainable, cost-effective, multi-purpose and flexible means for hydro-meteorological risk reduction. However, there are still many areas where further research and demonstration are needed in order to promote their upscaling and replication and to make them become mainstream solutions. © Author(s) 2020.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) provide a promising means to a climate resilient future. To guide investments in NBS, stated preference studies have become a common tool to evaluate the benefits of NBS in developing countries. Due to subsistence lifestyles and generally lower incomes, SP studies in developing countries increasingly use time payments as an alternative to the traditionally implemented money payments. It remains unclear, however, how time values should be converted into money values, how the payment affects willingness to pay (WTP) estimates, and how this influence varies across settings with different levels of market integration. We compare the results of choice experiments that use either time or money payments and that are implemented in urban and rural Ghana. The choice experiments target to value different NBS aimed at erosion prevention and other ecosystem service benefits along the highly erosion prone Ghanaian coastline. Time payments are converted into monetary units using two generic wage-based conversion rates and one novel individual-specific non-wage-based conversion rate. We find higher WTP estimates for the time payments. Moreover, we find that the underlying implicit assumptions related to the currently commonly applied generic wage-based conversion rates do not hold. Finally, we find higher levels of market integration and smaller WTP disparities in the urban site, providing evidence that market integration allows for convergence of WTP estimates. These results provide guidance on the accurate estimation of NBS benefits through the implementation of stated preference studies with time payments. © Copyright © 2021 Hagedoorn, Koetse and van Beukering.',\n",

Although awareness on climate adaptation is on the rise, new approaches for urban development are still in development. Moreover, existing approaches mainly focus on local-scale levels or lack a crossover with urban and landscape planning. The present contribution offers an example of an integrated approach bridging urban climatology, landscape planning, and governance to assess and develop climate adaptation solutions linking city and district levels. The city of Verona was taken as a case study to test this approach and its implications for the development of a green and blue infrastructure with a climate-responsive master plan for the district of Verona South. Through critical reflection on the application of the approach to the case study, we aimed to identify its potentials and barriers.

This study was to investigate the capacity of pollutant removal by the green roofs with C4, C3, and CAM plant species when irrigated with domestic wastewater. Results showed that green roofs removed 79.27~97.38% of total suspended solids, 79.94~98.92% of chemical oxygen demand, 65.26~90.52% of total nitrogen, 83.32~96.31% of ammonium nitrogen, 77.83~93.97% of nitrate nitrogen, and 93.77~98.94% of total phosphorus, respectively. C4 and C3 plants contributed significantly higher runoff reduction, removal of total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphates, and total phosphorus than CAM plants. Water quality indicated by chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and total phosphorus from the effluent complied with the widely accepted limits on domestic wastewater discharge.

Nature-Based Solutions are of particular importance in the areas of strict city centers, where historical building structures are subject to legal protection. In this study, the authors tested the influence of high greenery on the microclimatic conditions in the areas of typical street canyons (east–west and north–south orientations). Authors included the established greenery strategy by the City Planning Department. To estimate the impact of the assumed scenarios, a CFD tool was used—the ENVI-met application, which is commonly used in the field of urban microclimatology. Studies have shown that the introduction of 10% of green area contributed to a maximum air temperature reduction of 0.80◦C (17:00) in an east–west-oriented canyon, 0.49◦C (10:00) in a north–south canyon. The scenarios, assumed by the City Planning Department, related to the introduction of a greater amount of greenery turned out to be a less effective solution.

While tailored NBS tools could facilitate and accelerate this process, a comprehensive mapping of their availability and capacity to respond to cities’ challenges is missing. This research aims to provide an overview of tools that intend to facilitate the uptake of NBS for urban climate adaptation supporting cities in overcoming their challenges. To do so, this paper (i) presents the results of interviews and workshops with municipal officers and decision-makers from different European cities that identified the challenges they experience with NBS uptake; (ii) selects and reviews NBS tools and (iii) analyzes them on their capacity to address these implementation challenges. Our research revealed four key challenges that municipal officers experience: resources availability; level of expertise, know-how or competence; the institutional setting, and collaborative governance and planning. The results from the tools’ review show that existing tools can support overcoming a lack of expertise (31), but, to a smaller extent, can also be of use when experiencing the institutional setting (13), availability of resources (11), and collaborative governance and planning (10) as a challenge.

For that, we set up a pollination experiment and quantified services and yield provided by current pollination vectors, and under optimal pollination, over two years in a total of twenty‐three orchards covering the kiwifruit production range in Portugal. We characterized nine fruit traits and used: (1) fruit weight to calculate pollination deficits and relate them with pollinator diversity and abundance, and environmental variables; and (2) production values, fruit caliber, and market values to calculate economic impact of pollination deficits. Results showed that pollination deficits were variable in time and space and were significantly and negatively correlated with pollinator abundance, while the opposite pattern was obtained for production, supporting the notion that a higher pollinator’s abundance is related to lower pollination deficits and higher yields. Understanding the factors affecting pollination deficits is crucial to depict the need for nature‐based solutions promoting pollinators and to resort to management practices assisting pollination. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The paper investigates a particular phenomenon of the industrialization of Southern Italy, starting from the second post-war period, and, in particular, the unsolved relationship between some large industrial areas and the territories of the medium and small cities on which such productive “plates” have been installed. The town planning policies and instruments with which the industrialization of Southern Italy was planned, on the contrary, foresaw a strong integration between urban fabric and industrial agglomerations. Through the case study of the province of Caserta, the research illustrated by the paper investigates, first of all, the policies that supported this process of industrialization and what the territorial effects of this phenomenon were. Next, the paper illustrates the method of knowledge and mapping of the territory of the case study of the industrial development area of Caserta. The data will be collected in a GIS platform that will return the following condition that is nowadays not available: analytical maps of the brownfield areas and the identification of the areas still intact, agricultural or green areas, urban areas and infrastructures, which trace a cognitive framework addressed to the project in which it will possible to experiment some possible eco-innovative and nature-based solutions. © 2021 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is a nature-based solution that has gained importance in the context of international climate policy, such as in the EU Adaptation Strategy (2013), which explicitly encourages its adoption and which should continue in The European Green Deal. This study aims to analyze how the EbA concept has been adopted in strategic adaptation planning at the municipal and intermunicipal levels in Portugal after the publication of the European adaptation strategy in 2013. Thus, a quantitative content analysis was carried out, based on EbA keywords, of municipal strategies and intermunicipal plans in Portugal. The term “ecosystem-based” has not been transposed as an explicit objective at the municipal and intermunicipal levels. All strategies and plans have included indirect references to the underlying elements of the EbA concept. This study highlights that although the EU Adaptation Strategy explicitly encourages EbA, this does not mean that it is adopted as a preferred adaptation approach at the local level in Portugal. The EbA seems to be more widely understood by the research community than by municipal technicians or private companies. It is necessary to explore how the EbA concept can be more widely accepted through the generation of co-benefits and by synergies between topics. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Soil erosion during rainfall events is affected by several factors, such as topography, soil type, land management, and vegetation cover. In this study, a series of tests investigates the influence of selected perennial herbaceous plants with a deep and strong rooting system, called MC1, on runoff generation and soil erosion. The tests on the investigated nature‐based solution have been performed in the Cape Fear experimental hillslope with natural and artificial rainfall and for different vegetation heights. For all the experiments, runoff, soil moisture, and erosion data were observed and collected. The results obtained in this study suggest the following conclusions: (1) MC1 is effective in terms of soil erosion reduction already with a minimum vegetation height equal to 30 cm; (2) MC1 maximum efficiency, in terms of soil loss reduction, has been reached for a vegetation height equal to 70 cm; (3) In terms of the eroded material, the use of MC1 allows for a reduction of soil loss up to 300 times higher than the bare soil condition; (4) The use of MC1 allows for a reduction in the runoff coefficient up to 1/3 of the corresponding value in the bare soil condition. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Sustainable urban drainage systems are multi-functional nature-based solutions that can facilitate flood management in urban catchments while improving stormwater runoff quality. Traditionally, the evaluation of the performance of sustainable drainage infrastructure has been limited to a narrow set of design objectives to simplify their implementation and decision-making process. In this study, the spatial design of sustainable urban drainage systems is optimized considering five objective functions, including minimization of flood volume, flood duration, average peak runoff, total suspended solids, and capital cost. This allows selecting an ensemble of admissible portfolios that best trade-off capital costs and the other important urban drainage services. The impact of the average surface slope of the urban catchment on the optimal design solutions is discussed in terms of spatial distribution of sustainable drainage types. Results show that different subcatchment slopes result in non-uniform distributional designs of sustainable urban drainage systems, with higher capital costs and larger surface areas of green assets associated with steeper slopes. This has two implications. First, urban areas with different surface slopes should not have a one-size-fits-all design policy. Second, spatial equality must be taken into account when applying optimization models to urban subcatchments with different surface slopes to avoid unequal distribution of environmental and human health co-benefits associated with green drainage infrastructure. © 2021, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Wetlands have a major influence on the global carbon cycle, with capacity to act as carbon ‘sinks’ or ‘sources’. The source-sink capacity of wetlands is governed by microbially-mediated biogeochemical processes, which are furthermore regulated by environmental conditions. With growing interest in nature-based climate solutions, policymakers and resource managers seek information on ways how wetlands can be managed to maximize carbon drawdown. Here, we explored how rehabilitation (i.e., fencing and grazing removal) influences greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil biogeochemistry (microbial communities and soil quality) from semi-arid, rain-filled freshwater wetlands in south-eastern Australia. Specifically, we investigated the carbon and microbes response under major local environmental factors, such as vegetation type (graminoids vs eucalyptus tree) and seasonal hydroperiod (spring vs autumn), across wetlands that are currently used for grazing or cropping and those that have been under fencing rehabilitation for up to 20 years. We found that rehabilitation did not reduce CO2 and CH4 emissions, rather CH4 flux rates were elevated when the wetlands were flooded (spring). Anaerobic conditions from spring waterlogged soils also increased microbial diversity by 2.6-fold, and influenced the relative abundance of putative methane oxidizers (Nitrososphaerales and Mixococcales) and methanogenic archaea (Methanomicrobia, Methanobacteria). Organic matter quality (measured as C:N ratio) was reduced by the removal of grazing pressure in eucalyptus-dominated sites only. Soil quality, influenced by vegetation type, also had a significant impact on relative abundance of putative nitrogen and carbon cyclers. Overall, our results suggest that fencing rehabilitation in semi-arid rain-filled wetlands had a minor impact on microbial dynamics and carbon processes, overshadowed by the influence of the water table and vegetation type. Focusing future research on spatial and temporal patterns of carbon and microbe rehabilitation responses will help managers devise the most effective rehabilitation practice within a particular geographical area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Growing and uncontrolled urbanization and climate change (with an associated increase in the frequency of intense meteoric events) have led to a rising number of flooding events in urban areas due to the insufficient capacity of conventional drainage systems. Nature-Based Solutions represent a contribution to addressing these problems through the creation of a multifunctional green infrastructure, both in urban areas and in the countryside. The aim of this work was to develop a methodology to define Green Infrastructure for stormwater management at the municipal level. The methodology is defined on the basis of three phases: The definition of the territorial information needed, the production of base maps, and the production of a Suitability Map. In the first phase, we define the information needed for the identification of non-urbanized areas where rainwater can potentially infiltrate, as well as areas with soil characteristics that can exclude or limit rainwater infiltration. In the second phase, we constructed the following base maps: A “map of green areas”, a “map of natural surface infiltration potential” and a “map of exclusion areas”. In phase 3, starting from the base maps created in phase 2 and using Geographical Information Systems’ (GIS) geoprocessing procedures, the “Green area compatibility map to realize Green Infrastructure”, the “map of areas not suitable for infiltration” and the final “Green Infrastructure Suitability Map” are created. This methodology should help municipal authorities to set up Green Infrastructure Suitability Maps as a tool for land-use planning. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",

To fill the gap in the design-making process of implementing NBS, a framework that incorporates the landscape dynamics into the design of NBS is expedient and beneficial. This research addresses the above gap and presents a practically applicable framework for large-scale NBS that incorporates landscape dynamics into the design of NBS. To amplify the power of stakeholders’ involvement and evidence-based knowledge (i.e., field experiences and literature reports), the framework developed in this study was evaluated on a case-study site in Odense area, Denmark, within the EU-funded RECONECT project. Furthermore, this study also addresses the relationship between landscape dynamics and biodiversity by performing a detailed literature review.

Communities face growing challenges due to environmental stressors such as climate change, with vulnerable communities experiencing a disproportionate burden of adverse health outcomes. The interdependencies between urban planning and public health outcomes are inextricable, with respect to improving access to healthier built environments for vulnerable and marginalized groups. Widespread implementation of nature-based solutions, such as green infrastructure, provides a multi-functional strategy to support sustainable development, increase climate resilience, enhance ecological connectivity, and create healthier communities. A Health Equity Impact Assessment presents the findings of a participatory research study utilizing key informant interviews of public health unit professionals (eight) and a survey of green infrastructure volunteers and workers (36) on the impact of green infrastructure on individual and community mental and physical well-being, service use, and perceived unmet needs, using Ontario, Canada as a case study. Study findings indicate that where green infrastructure is both productive and publicly accessible, the benefits were significant for vulnerable populations. These benefits include increased social connectivity, skills development, and food security.

In response, natural infrastructure is increasingly recognized for its potential to enhance resilience and improve human well-being. Here, we examine the role of the ecosystem services and resilience approaches in urban planning, which both aim to sustain the long-term benefits of natural infrastructure in cities. While the two approaches are intertwined and share deep roots in social-ecological systems framing, they confer complementary strengths in practice, which we illustrate with a case study in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. We show that, at present, the main strength of ecosystem service practice is to provide actionable information, while urban resilience practice supports the development of holistic long-term strategies. We discuss operational limitations of both approaches and suggest that understanding and leveraging their complementary strengths could help bridge the implementation gap between research and practice in urban natural infrastructure planning. © Copyright © 2021 Hamel, Hamann, Kuiper, Andersson, Arkema, Silver, Daily and Guerry.',\n",

       " 'While the developmental dynamics of ecosystems have been studied in many natural systems, it is unclear if these patterns are to be expected in engineered ecosystems where components have not co-developed over time. Green roofs often begin with a nutrient rich substrate that is paired with slow-growing plants adapted to nutrient poor conditions - perhaps resulting in different developmental dynamics than natural ecosystems. We evaluated changes over time in green roof nutrient content and vegetation communities using a chronosequence in southern Sweden of similarly designed but different aged green roofs spanning between 2 and 22 years. Substrate depth, substrate nitrogen (N), and total N pool sizes varied positively with roof age. These dynamics suggest an accumulation of 2.9 ± 1.1 g N/m2/yr with no indication of leveling off after 22 years. Plant N content (%) positively varied with roof age but plant biomass, plant nutrient pools, and plant diversity did not vary with age. These dynamics indicate a novel developmental scenario where the ecosystem begins with near-stable plant biomass but still accumulates N in the substrate at rates on par with many secondary successional systems. The apparent accumulation of N could not be accounted for by N deposition rates for the region, suggesting substantial N-fixation. The novel developmental dynamics outlined in this study point to the need for a new or expanded ecosystem developmental paradigm that better suits green roofs and perhaps other emerging engineered ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

However, research on mapping plant communities of QVPs using remotely sensed data has not been conducted. In this study, we found that the pan-sharpened GF-1 imagery acquired in May was suitable for mapping plant communities of QVPs. Guided by field survey data and finer spatial resolution remotely sensed data, we constructed a simple decision tree classifier using the tasseled cap brightness (TCB), greenness (TCG), and topsoil grain size index (TGSI) of the pan-sharpened GF-1 image acquired in May. The classification results showed that the combination of the TCB and TCG components could efficiently distinguish the vegetation from non-vegetation, and the use of the TGSI was able to capture the variations in plant communities within QVPs in the YRD, China. However, the influence of the acquisition season and mixed pixels of GF-1 imagery (especially small canopy T. chinensis in small QVPs) on classification accuracy still needs further investigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",

Through their regulating services and by providing natural protection, ecosystems can reduce physical exposure to common natural hazards. Ecosystems can also minimize disaster risk by reducing social and economic vulnerability and enhancing livelihood resilience. To showcase the importance and usefulness of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR), this study (1) analyzed the land use change in a watershed in central Japan, (2) applied the concept of Eco-DRR, and made land use management recommendations regarding the watershed scale for reducing the risk of downstream flooding. The recommendations that emerged from the application, based on the land use change analysis, are: the use of hard infrastructure and vegetation to store and retain/detain stormwater and promote evapotranspiration is recommended for downstream, urban areas; the sustainable management of upland forest ecosystems and secondary forest-paddy land-human systems, and proactive land use planning in the lowland delta, where built land is concentrated, are key to the watershed-scale landscape planning and management to reduce downstream flooding risks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"Agricultural activities such as row-cropping and grazing, have accelerated stream bank erosion. Accelerated stream bank erosion increases nonpoint source pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, significantly degrading them. Mitigating stream bank erosion is a priority worldwide, especially in agricultural watersheds. The objective of this study was to analyze the impacts of riparian land-use management on stream bank erosion and deposition, along with analyzing its temporal and spatial patterns. The study was conducted in three regions of Iowa (central, northeast and southeast) along 30 stream reaches adjacent to seven different riparian land-uses. The riparian land-uses were riparian forest buffers, grass filters, pastures with the cattle excluded from the stream, intensive rotational grazing, rotational grazing, continuous grazing and row crop fields. Seasonal erosion and deposition data (Spring, Summer and Autumn) were collected along these reaches for 5 years and yearly for the following two years. To analyze the data, conventional statistical methods (ANOVA and Tukey's test) along with innovative techniques (percentile plots, cumulative erosion curves and bubble charts) were utilized. Based on the analysis, of this extensive in time (seven years) and large in size (1500 pins measured 17 times in three regions) field dataset, major results were obtained in regard to stream bank erosion in Iowa, USA. Stream banks exhibited high year-to-year variation in erosion and deposition showcasing the need for long-term datasets to better understand stream bank erosion and deposition. Seasonal erosion, also had high variability with Spring recording the most erosion followed by Summer and Autumn. Certain seasons exhibited high stream bank erosion indicating that managers need to focus on these seasons, to reduce erosion effectively. In addition, seasonal measurements can highlight depositional events that might be masked with annual measurements. Riparian land-uses significantly impacted stream bank erosion. Riparian forest buffers and grass filters significantly mitigated stream bank erosion while traditional agricultural practices like continuous grazing and row-crop agriculture had accelerated stream bank erosion. Finally, the percentile plots, cumulative erosion curves and bubble charts captured some stream bank responses that would have been unnoticed using conventional statistical methods, allowing decision makers, stakeholders and the general public, to support and approve measures to mitigate this environmental problem. Nature-based solutions utilizing riparian perennial vegetation can sustainably mitigate stream bank erosion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'In the context of climate change, Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs), a recently developed concept, are increasingly considered as part of the adaptation strategies of the cities. Studies using expert models and methods (EMM) receive a great deal of scientific attention. Considering EMM increasing use, this study aims to perform an analysis of the reported evaluation results, reflecting the capability of the EMM to accurately tackle urban challenges identified within the EU Nature4Cities project. Then, we propose a set of indicators and recommendations about sixteen EMM to be used by funders, researchers and practitioners when evaluating the performance of NBSs. The coupling of the different components (climate, water and soil) is not a simple matter. The analysis relies on the definition of the range of the reported metrics and on the investigation of the relationship between the various indices, applied for the EMM evaluation. Secondly, the study assesses the existing EMM, indicating the potential of NBSs: (i) to reduce urban heat island, (ii) to limit surface warming, (iii) to increase the thermal comfort of people, (iv) to limit the overheating and runoff of surfaces due to impervious areas, (v) to increase water retention during stormy episodes, (vi) to improve storm water quality at the outlet of the sustainable urban drainage systems, (vii) to promote the filtration and epuration of storm water runoff in soil and (viii) to be a support for vegetation. The analysis reveals that EMM can be considered as helpful tools for urban microclimate, urban soil and water management analysis, provided their limitations and characteristics are taken into account by the user when choosing tools and interpreting results (e.g. application scale). With regard to the performance of NBSs, the most commonly used indicators clearly depend on the scale of the project. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'Different ways of thinking and understanding urban problems and imagining solutions are needed to redress the suite of serious challenges facing cities. Focusing on urban nature, this conceptual paper begins from the standpoint that nature-based solutions (NBS) could help remake cities as places for more than just people; in other words, cities could encourage the flourishing of multiple species and ecosystems, including but not limited to, humans. Although cities were once considered ‘biodiversity wastelands’, they are now recognised as providing important habitat. However, NBS have been plagued by criticisms of anthropocentrism whereby human needs are prioritised over those of other species and ecosystems. To overcome this problem, the paper provides an outline of more-than-human thinking and suggests how relational concepts can help NBS move beyond an inherent anthropocentrism, and also begins to work through some of the complexities of making this shift. More-than-human thinking and theories have arisen in several disciplines, but despite a considerable presence in the literature, they have not yet been brought into conversation with NBS. The paper concludes that more-than-human thinking can generate deeper understanding of the interdependencies between all the entities that comprise cities, such that more inclusive NBS could be implemented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Sweetpotato weevil (SPW) pest management is challenging because the pest target is sub-terranean, so the application of pesticides is impractical and usually ineffective. Host plant resistance and the genetic transformation of sweetpotatoes to produce entomotoxic Bt proteins offer potential for environmentally benign pest control. Resistance can be conferred by naturally occurring hydroxycinnamic acids which protect against oviposition by adults, but these compounds are restricted to the root surface so do not protect against the cortex bound larvae where the greatest damage occurs. Resistance could be enhanced if combined with expression of Bt proteins in transformed plants, but interactions between hydroxycinnamic acids and Bt proteins remain unknown. Here the bioactivity of Cry7Aa1 protein and hydroxycinnamic acid esters was evaluated individually and in combination against SPW larvae and mortality determined. Low and high concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acid esters alone caused significantly higher mortality of both weevil species in all experiments compared to the control. SPW larval mortality was greater when tested as a combination of hydroxycinnamic acid esters and Bt protein, but this effect was additive not synergistic. Although we report no evidence of antagonistic interactions, the antifeedant effects of the plant compounds conferring host plant resistance could have reduced consumption of the Bt protein in our assays leading to a lower efficacy when combined. Further work is required to determine whether the toxic effects of Bt proteins function alongside host plant resistance in sweetpotato under field conditions. © 2020, The Author(s).',\n",

An analytical framework is applied to advance the understanding of EbA approaches and how they lead to synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services provision at spatial and temporal scales and multiple stakeholders. Our results show that EbA approaches such as ecosystem restoration have the potential to generate multiple adaptation benefits as well as synergies and trade-offs occurring at different temporal and spatial scales and affecting various stakeholder groups.

       " 'To base urbanization on nature, inspiring ecologies are necessary. The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) could be helpful in achieving this goal. State of the art urban planning starts from the aim to realize a (part of) a city, not to improve natural quality or increase biodiversity. The aim of this article is to introduce a planning approach that puts the ecological landscape first, before embedding urban development. This ambition is explored using three NBS frameworks as the input for a series of design workshops, which conceived a regional plan for the Western Sydney Parklands in Australia. From these frameworks, elements were derived at three abstraction levels as the input for the design process: envisioning a long‐term future (scanning the opportunities), evaluating the benefits and disadvantages, and identifying a common direction for the design (determining directions), and implementing concrete spatial cross‐cutting solutions (creating inspiring ecologies), ultimately resulting in a regional landscape‐based plan. The findings of this research demonstrate that, at every abstraction, a specific outcome is found: a mapped ecological landscape showing the options for urbanization, formulating a food‐forest strategy as the commonly found direction for the design, and a regional plan that builds from the landscape ecologies adding layers of productive ecologies and urban synergies. By using NBS‐frameworks, the potentials of putting the ecological landscape first in the planning process is illuminated, and urbanization can become resilient and nature‐inclusive. Future research should emphasize the balance that should be established between the NBS‐frameworks and the design approach, as an overly technocratic and all‐encompassing framework prevents the freedom of thought that is needed to come to fruitful design propositions. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The objective of this work was to assess the environmental performances of advanced biofuels produced from perennial energy crops (miscanthus and willow) grown in bioenergy buffer strips (BBS) and compare them with the environmental performances of alternative systems providing the same function, i.e. private mobility. The growing evidence of potentially negative environmental impacts of bioenergy pathways calls for renewed efforts in identifying win-win bioenergy pathways, thus capable of mitigating climate change without worsening other environmental impacts. An holistic approach encompassing all the relevant areas of environmental concern is thus fundamental to highlight environmental trade-offs. Therefore, in this study we follow an attributional Life Cycle Assessment approach, but our analysis includes detailed modelling of biogenic carbon pools, nutrients cycles, infrastructures’ impacts as well as the expansion of the system boundaries to include the fuel use. We find that the fragmented and linear configuration of the buffer strips does not affect significantly the GHG emissions of lignocellulosic ethanol for BBS compared to growing the crops in open field. Additionally, we find that ethanol from perennials grown in BBS has the potential to reduce several other environmental impacts associated to private mobility. Firstly, the cultivation of miscanthus and willow in BBS enables both the removal of nutrients from the environment and the removal of carbon from the atmosphere, through the creation of an additional terrestrial sink. Secondly, when compared to the use of fossil gasoline, bioethanol from BBS crops generates lower impacts on all other areas of environmental concern, such as resources depletion or air pollution. We also find that cars fuelled with bioethanol form buffer strips perform even better than electric vehicles in all the impact categories analysed except for acidification and particulate matter emissions, where battery electric vehicles running on renewables perform slightly better. We conclude that bioethanol from perennial crops grown in BBS is a good example of nature-based solution, able to reduce GHG emissions without shifting the environmental burden on other areas of environmental concern. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NbS) can address climate change, biodiversity loss, human well-being and their interactions in an integrated way. A major barrier to achieving this is the lack of comprehensiveness in current carbon accounting which has focused on flows rather than stocks of carbon and led to perverse outcomes. We propose a new comprehensive approach to carbon accounting based on the whole carbon cycle, covering both stocks and flows, and linking changes due to human activities with responses in the biosphere and atmosphere. We identify enhancements to accounting, namely; inclusion of all carbon reservoirs, changes in their condition and stability, disaggregated flows, and coverage of all land areas. This comprehensive approach recognises that both carbon stocks (as storage) and carbon flows (as sequestration) contribute to the ecosystem service of global climate regulation. In contrast, current ecosystem services measurement and accounting commonly use only carbon sequestration measured as net flows, while greenhouse gas inventories use flows from sources to sinks. This flow-based accounting has incentivised planting and maintaining young forests with high carbon uptake rates, resulting, perversely, in failing to reveal the greater mitigation benefit from protecting larger, more stable and resilient carbon stocks in natural forests. We demonstrate the benefits of carbon storage and sequestration for climate mitigation, in theory as ecosystem services within an ecosystem accounting framework, and in practice using field data that reveals differences in results between accounting for stocks or flows. Our proposed holistic and comprehensive carbon accounting makes transparent the benefits, trade-offs and shortcomings of NbS actions for climate mitigation and sustainability outcomes. Adopting this approach is imperative for revision of ecosystem accounting systems under the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting and contributing to evidence-based decision-making for international conventions on climate (UNFCCC), biodiversity (CBD) and sustainability (SDGs). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

       " 'METland is a new variety of Constructed Wetland (CW) for treating wastewater where gravel is replaced by a biocompatible electroconductive material to stimulate the metabolism of electroactive bacteria. The system requires a remarkably low land footprint (0.4 m2 /pe) compared to conventional CW, due to the high pollutant removal rate exhibited by such microorganisms. In order to predict the optimal locations for METland, a methodology based on Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) techniques applied to Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed. Seven criteria were evaluated and weighted in the context of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Finally, a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) was performed using the Sobol method for resource optimization. The model was tested in two locations, oceanic and Mediterranean, to prove its feasibility in different geographical, demographic and climate conditions. The GSA revealed as conclusion the most influential factors in the model: (i) land use, (ii) distance to population centers, and (iii) distance to river beds. Interestingly, the model could predict best suitable locations by reducing the number of analyzed factors to just such three key factors (responsible for 78% of the output variance). The proposed methodology will help decision-making stakeholders in implementing nature-based solutions, including constructed wetlands, for treating wastewater in rural areas. © 2021 by the authors.',\n",

Many projects have been implemented to mitigate Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects using nature-based solutions. However, decision-making and selecting an adequate framework are difficult because of complex interactions between natural, social, economic and built environments. This paper contributes to the UHI issue by: (i) identifying the most important key factors of a Decision Support Tool (DST) used for urban heat mitigation, (ii) presenting multi-criteria methods applied to urban heat resilience, (iii) reviewing existing spatial and non-spatial DSTs, (iv) and analyzing, classifying and ranking DSTs. It aims to help decision-makers through an overview of the pros and cons of existing DSTs and indicate which tool is providing maximum support for choosing and planning heat resilience measures from the designing phase to the heat mitigation phase. This review shows that Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can be used for any pilot site and the criteria can be adapted to the given location accordingly. It also highlights that GISbased spatial tools have an effective decision support system (DSS) because they offer a quick assessment of interventions and predict long-term effects of urban heat. Through a comparative study using specific chosen criteria, we conclude that the DSS tool is well suited and fulfils many prerequisites to support new policies and interventions to mitigate UHS. © 2021 by the authors.',\n",

The European policy framework, including the recently released European Green Deal, could strongly boost the role and recognition of NBS and SUP as drivers of sustainable and inclusive urban transition. Through a content analysis of current environmental European policies, strategies and agreements, this paper provides (i) an overview of the state of the art of the environmental European policy framework and the recognized role of NBS and SUP in reaching defined objectives, and (ii) insights on where NBS and SUP could play a larger role within this framework. On this basis, the paper identifies gaps and develops recommendations for a better integration of such concepts into the current framework. © 2021 by the author.

       " 'The accuracy of photogrammetry for geohazards monitoring has improved within the last years because of the “drone revolution”. This study is an attempt to perform morphometric measurements in a landslide event that took place near the village Nea Zichni in Northern Greece. The DJI Mavic 2 Pro was selected to capture orthoimages of the entire area including the landslide event but also other adjusted disaster phenomena. The images were loaded in the commercial software Pix4D in order to produce orthomosaics and digital surface models of the area. The georeferenced results were further analyzed in ArcGIS in order to digitize and estimate the morphometric parameters of the landslide, such as its area and volume, but also to detect cracks and plot the tensile cracking directions. We conclude that the methodology and produced outputs are crucial for the responsible authorities to detect, monitor and mitigate natural disasters such as landslide events and other mass movements. The best practices to control mass movements are nature‐based solutions such as soil bioengineering and proper vegetation cover assisted by engineering measures. Finally, our goal is to frequently monitor the landslide phenomenon in order to determine its evolution. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Agriculture is being negatively affected by the decrease in precipitation that has been observed over the last few years. Even in the Czech Republic, farmers are being urged to irrigate their fields despite the fact that sources of water for irrigation are rapidly being depleted. This problem might be partially solved via the reuse of treated wastewater in certain agricultural sectors. However, the public perception of the reuse of wastewater remains negative primarily due to unknown risks to the environment and public health. To overcome this barrier, a semi-operated irrigation field was established at Kostelec nad Ohří in the Central Bohemian region of the Czech Republic and planted with common garden crops such as tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and lettuces (Lactuca sativa L.) irrigated with two different water sources, i.e., treated wastewater from a local nature-based treatment system, a hybrid constructed wetland (HCW), and local fresh water from well. The HCW was put into operation in 2017 and was reconstructed in 2018 and includes both horizontal and vertical flow beds; the trial irrigation field was added in the same year. The reconstruction of the facility significantly enhanced the removal efficiency with respect to all monitored parameters, e.g., biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), N–NH4+, total N and the suspended solids (TSS), except for total P. The HCW also ensured the significant removal of several observed pathogenic microorganisms (E. coli, intestinal enterococci and thermotolerant coliforms). During the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons, we observed the significantly enhanced growth of the crops irrigated with wastewater from the HCW due to the fertilizing effect. The risks associated with the contamination of crops irrigated with treated water are not negligible and it is necessary to pay sufficient attention to them, especially when introducing irrigation with wastewater into practice. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Australia is currently grappling with a range of social and environmental challenges, many of which impact the way our public health system, and society more broadly, function. In this short communication paper we explore urban agriculture in Australia as a Nature-Based Solution (NBS) to address some of the ecological, social, economic and health challenges facing the continent. We argue that urban agriculture has the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change extremes while simultaneously providing multiple benefits such as improving wellbeing, people-nature connections, and food security. We present three exemplar case studies diverse in geography, context and governance from Queensland, Tasmania, and New South Wales exploring verge gardening, market gardening, and a community greening program respectively to highlight the benefits of urban agriculture as a NBS. We advocate that various forms of urban agriculture need to be researched and considered for their potential impacts and multiple benefits to be fully supported, governed, and understood in light of the social-ecological challenges Australian cities face. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'Interest in nature-based approaches for climate change adaptation in cities is growing. Whilst there is a growing field of scholarship in a European and North America setting, research on the policy and governance of urban greenspace for climate adaptation in subtropical Asia is limited. Given the different development patterns, environmental characteristics and governance arrangements in subtropical cities, plus their comparatively large population and high climate risk, this is a significant knowledge gap. In response, this paper evaluates competences – skill sets, capabilities, and supporting policy and legislation – to enact adaptation through greenspace across different governance contexts; and assesses how international rhetoric on nature-based adaptation becomes localised to subtropical Asian city settings. We conduct interviews with stakeholders, plus review of relevant policy and city-specific research, for three cities with different governance and development contexts: Hanoi (Vietnam); Taipei (Taiwan); and Fukuoka (Japan). Across all three cases, we find that institutional structures and processes for connecting different remits and knowledge systems are a bigger challenge than a lack of appropriate policy or individuals with the required technical knowledge. However, opportunities for civil society participation and consideration of justice issues vary between the cities according to the socio-political context. These findings illustrate the value of individuals and organisations able to work across institutional boundaries in linking greenspace and adaptation agendas for subtropical Asian cities; and the importance of competence in collaboration with developers and civil society so that the rapid development or regeneration seen in subtropical Asian contexts does not tend towards green climate gentrification. More broadly, our findings show that the diverse nature of subtropical Asian cities means the role of greenspace in climate adaptation is likely to be context-specific, and thus that caution must be exercised against uncritically importing best practices from exemplar cases elsewhere. © 2021 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Living in a time of continuous crises, the effects of climate change, social unrest, and military conflicts are apparent at every turn. The loss and degradation of natural systems is an existential crisis for humanity; reversing the destruction is urgent international policy. The novel coronavirus pandemic and accompanying global economic recession have reversed recent gains in reducing poverty. The pandemic underscores the importance of nature: as a refuge from social isolation and a source of novel viruses. Viewed optimistically, this may be what the philosopher Gershom Scholem called “plastic hours,” a fortuitous alignment of public opinion, political power, and events that overcomes the desire to return to the status quo. “Building back better” with nature-based solutions after COVID 19 complements the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Experience from implementing forest landscape restoration (FLR) under the Bonn Challenge points the way forward. Implementing FLR requires balancing competing interests and differing priorities for livelihoods versus biodiversity while aligning local with national goals. People live in degraded landscapes and unless local needs are addressed, restoration likely fails. Experience shows that multi-stakeholder processes require skilled facilitators to plan, moderate, and monitor FLR. Initial experience with training FLR facilitators suggests the most promising option is a series of workshops followed by a mentorship program. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration',\n",
       " 'The demand for living space is rising in growing cities. To restrict urban expansion in the outskirts, a common strategy is to densify existing neighbourhoods. Densification implies the increase of water impervious area which increases the vulnerability to flooding during extreme precipitation events. Sustainable urban drainage systems are considered as a strategy to handle stormwater runoff locally and thus relieve the sewage system. This study investigates the combined quantitative hydrological impact of densification and sustainable stormwater management measures in a residential neighbourhood in Munich, Germany. The living-lab approach pursues the application of nature-based solutions in a real planning case to achieve positive climate effects while densifying the neighbourhood. The study is based on single event simulations of three return periods with the physically based software PCSWMM. The events are implemented for both current and climate change precipitation intensities of the RCP 8.5 projection for 2040–2069. Three scenarios are implemented: a status quo, a business as usual scenario (additional buildings without compensation measures) and a best-case scenario (one additional floor with green roofs disconnected from the sewers in combination with rain gardens and porous pavements on the land parcels). The comparison between the different scenarios focuses on three main aspects of the water balance, namely, infiltration, runoff and storage. The results show that measures for sustainable stormwater management are crucial elements to cope with an increasing number of heavy precipitation events due to climate change. The best-case scenario significantly outperforms the other two concerning water infiltration, surface runoff and storage. Most notably is the impact of climate change projection rainfall intensities for 2040–2069. The outcomes for these intensities clearly show the positive impact of sustainable water-sensitive design. The results demonstrate that it is in fact possible to enhance the water balance and gain new living space simultaneously if a sustainable urban planning strategy is implemented that includes future-oriented stormwater management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"Social-ecological justice is an emerging field that argues for nature's agency, social-ecological awareness, recognition of nature's capabilities, and participation in decision-making processes. A social-ecological justice perspective lifts the analysis out of a distribution of environmental impacts to humans, to a recognition of social-ecological complexities. However, bringing this perspective to urban planning requires a suite of methods and tools in coordination with existing planning methods that do not address issues of social-ecological justice, or, justice for nature. Drawing from existing methods and tools, this paper presents a novel methodology to define, identify, and map social-ecological injustices in urban landscapes. Three dimensions of social-ecological justice (distribution, recognition, and participation) are operationalised into a set of indicators, which are added to create a Social-Ecological Injustices Index that identifies place hotspots. A fourth dimension, capabilities, is discussed, but not operationalised in the paper. The urban region of Melbourne, which has been undergoing intense urbanisation processes, is used as a case study to test the applicability of this index. The geospatial analysis reveals various degrees of social-ecological injustices across the Melbourne Metropolitan region and unveils the location of the most deprived areas. This methodology can be applied as a systematic and effective way for urban planners and decision-makers to identify and target social-ecological injustice hotspots as areas of prioritisation for urban regeneration with nature-based solutions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'To extend the application of stormwater biofilters (known also as bioretention systems or raingarden) under varied climate conditions, the concept of dual-mode biofilters (i.e., a biofilter that treats two sources of water) has recently emerged. However, studies of these systems have been limited to the laboratory-scale, and validation of the new concept at the field-scale is paramount. This paper presents results from the first field study on two full-scale dual-mode biofilters that operate under different climate conditions and operational regimes. The first, a dual-mode stormwater-greywater biofilter located in Jurong, China, received stormwater and greywater in various combinations. The second, a dual-mode stormwater-groundwater biofilter in Kfar-Sava, Israel, treats stormwater in the wet season and contaminated groundwater in the dry season. It was observed that the stormwater-greywater (Jurong) biofilter was able to provide effective treatment for the majority of pollutants regardless of time of the year, water source, or operational mode (stormwater-only, greywater-only or mixed). Higher levels of greywater nitrogen (total nitrogen ~5.5 mg/L, about two times that in local stormwater) and carbon (e.g., BOD5 110 mg/L about ten times that in stormwater) were also found to positively impact nitrogen removal. The stormwater-groundwater (Kfar-Sava) biofilter was able to effectively treat stormwater, with up to 73% removal of total nitrogen, however, when groundwater containing high levels of nitrate (up to 150 mg/L, compared to &lt;1 mg/L in local stormwater) was introduced, relatively poor performance was observed (maximum of 35% removal). However, the system was able to treat groundwater when smaller volumes were introduced at lower inflow rates. Under these operating conditions, outflow concentrations of nitrate were reduced by 77%. Additionally, imposing a dry period of more than two weeks was able to improve the nitrate removal performance even under higher inflow volumes. These field studies enrich our understanding of underlaying treatment processes, confirm past laboratory findings, and most importantly suggest that dual-mode biofilters are robust nature-based water treatment solutions that can be applied in a range of climates and operating settings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Conventional centralized drainage systems are not only expensive, but their mono-function to discharge surface runoff also imposes a negative effect on the local environment while compounding regional watershed dysfunction. Sponge city initiative promoted by the Chinese government is a broader sustainable stormwater management concept that aims to use more nature-based solutions, reduce urban flooding and runoff pollution, and increase rainwater resource usage. As part of decentralized and cost-effective solutions, green infrastructure (GI) is considered in the Sponge City development across China. Although GI has been successfully implemented through a range of small-scale projects, the GI approach has not been adopted widely, which is because the GI approach is micro-scale techniques and the local government is skeptical about the efficiency of GI to mitigate stormwater on a large scale. Although some researchers have explored the effectiveness of GI to reduce stormwater in small catchments, only a limited number of studies have examined the efficacy of GI at the watershed scale. Moreover, there is lack of a system and cross-scale approach in sponge city practices. To understand the effect of GI on the watershed scale, this paper proposed a comprehensive approach using ArcGIS and SWMM platforms to study the spatial configuration and implementation of multi-scale stormwater management. The approach is to apply a three-step sequence of catchments, sub-catchments, and micro-catchments for the urban watershed through designing interconnected network of landscape infrastructure (LI) systems. The design scenarios and performance of LI system-based approach with different combinations and sizes of the sponge facilities were analyzed based on the Old Town district of Hefei City, China. This study demonstrated that the inherent capacity of the landscape can act as the conduit for multifunctional, flexible, localized, and synergistic infrastructural systems, in which cross watershed holds promise to decrease both runoff volumes and peak flows while providing ecosystem services, such as enhancing neighborhood aesthetics and cultural/health benefits through shared public green spaces. Thus, Sponge City Development here as green concepts and techniques for nature-based solutions enhances the function and value of green infrastructure with benefits of ecological, economic and social significances, which presents a new approach for sustainable city making. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'Owing to their high shoreline-to-land-area ratios, islands are especially sensitive to coastal change and their inhabitants especially vulnerable to associated impacts. In places along island coasts where shoreline recession is particularly noticeable and/or its impacts most severe, perhaps because adjacent population densities are unusually high, a common response has been to build a seawall. While this solution may appear instinctively correct, studies suggest otherwise, even to the point where seawall construction, particularly outside urban areas, might be considered maladaptive – neither solving the intended problem in the short-term nor helping coastal peoples cope effectively with longer-term shoreline change. Seawall construction can be viewed as part of a broader group of maladaptive solutions that are uncritically embraced by island peoples who may judge the efficacy of these solutions by their success in (wealthier) continental or urban contexts. More effective and sustainable approaches involve nature-based solutions in the short term and planning for transformative responses involving relocation in the longer term. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Biodiversity-friendly farming practices are taking centre stage, with herbicide use sparking major public debate on human health. Vegetation cover is increasingly used to enhance agroecosystem biodiversity and functions, providing important ecosystem services like biological pest control. However, further information is required on the relationship between vegetation cover, natural enemies, and pest predation. Using a sentinel prey experiment set up in 26 Mediterranean organic vineyards, we analysed the response of generalist predators, and the associated final predation and dynamics under three inter-row management types: bare soil, one out of two inter-rows vegetated and all inter-rows vegetated. Predation on sentinel prey was monitored on the ground and on the vine trunk throughout the daytime and after a night of exposure. Generalist predator abundance was quantified using pitfall traps. Final sentinel prey predation both on vine trunks and on the ground were significantly higher in fully vegetated vineyards, with a shorter prey survival time than in tilled vineyards. Both diurnal and nocturnal predation were significantly related to increased vegetation cover and richness. Moreover, 96 % of the identified predation events involved ants. We demonstrated the key role of vegetation cover in improving the predation function through a spill-over from the inter-row to the grapevine. Contrary to what is commonly observed in agrosystems, we clearly identified ants as the predominant predator both on the ground and on the vine trunk. Our study has important implications for Mediterranean vineyard management, promoting vegetation as a nature-based solution. Sustainable management of vineyard vegetation favouring the natural predator community may contribute to a reduction in pesticide use and fossil fuel consumption. © 2021',\n",
       " 'Most studies of urban forest management look at vegetation on public land. Yet, to meet ambitious urban forest targets, cities must attempt to maintain or increase trees and canopy cover on private urban land too. In this study, we review and evaluate international approaches to protecting and retaining trees on private urban land. Our study combines a systematic academic literature review, two empirical social science studies on the views of urban forest professionals, and a global case study review of innovative regulations and incentives aimed at protecting and retaining trees on private urban land. Case studies were evaluated for the extent they exceeded minimum standards or went beyond ‘business-as-usual’. We found that the most innovative mechanisms combine many regulations, instead of relying on a single regulation, and use financial incentives to retain or plant trees in newly developed or re-developed sites, as well as private residences. We did not find any cases where appropriate monitoring was in place to determine the efficacy and efficiency of these mechanisms. We also found no single simple solution that could effectively and efficiently protect and retain trees on private land. Only by combining policies, planning schemes, local laws, and financial incentives with community engagement and stewardship will cities protect and retain trees on private land. Useful and innovative ways to protecting and retaining trees on private land involves providing solutions at multiple governments levels, embedding trees in existing strategic policy and management solutions, incentivising positive behavior, creating regulations that require payment up front, and engaging the broader community in private tree stewardship. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'This study introduces the Transversal Connectivity Index (TCI) as an ecological indicator for classifying the natural landscape patches by their effective transversal connectivity to the water surfaces. The method applies specifically to urban areas at which the quality of blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is of fundamental importance in reducing the climate change consequences. Effective transversal connectivity among the BGI at the metropolitan scale supplies various ecosystem services in support of nature-based solutions for emerging urban challenges. The TCI value is computed (determined) by integrating a variety of existing and novel landscape indicators into an equation. The connectivity indicators belong to two categories: the intra-patch consists of the isoperimetric quotient, and patch ecological indicator, and the inter-patch ones listed as the band level, the shared border ratio, and the transport fragmentation buffer. The method is tested on the metropolitan zone of Berlin, and the results reveal unconventional findings of the effectiveness of BGI in urbanized landscapes. Despite the abundant green surfaces present in Berlin, only 50% of them have direct access to freshwater surfaces, based on Urban Atlas land use land cover data. The proposed indexing method is reproducible for other metropolitan areas, leading to comparative evaluation of effective BGI, having direct implications with emerging agendas of metropolitan management and policy making like the City Biodiversity Index, the concept of Sponge City, and Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'The objective of the manuscript was to evaluate the concentration and distribution of nutrients and heavy metals (HMs) in the sediments of urban lakes, as well as the potential ecological risk to the lake. This paper discusses the risk assessment and its management via potential nature-based solutions (NBS), which are lessons learnt from nature. The HM pollution and potential ecological risk were evaluated using conventional geo-accumulation index (GI) and geo-accumulation vector (GV) model. So urban lakes are usually more of a source of pollution than non-urban lakes, and more widely based on the literature on lake sediment pollution assessments in China over the past 10\\xa0years, 42 urban lakes, and 5 typical non-urban lakes (five representative freshwater lakes in China) were selected. The average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); and Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cd, Ni, As, and Hg were 2382, 712, 33.10, 118.05, 38.30, 66.40, 0.82, 32.38, 11.33, and 0.12\\xa0mg/kg, respectively. The pollution levels of nutrients and HMs in sediments were evaluated using a single pollution index, a comprehensive pollution index, a ground accumulation index, a potential ecological risk index, and a sediment quality index. The evaluation results showed that the overall pollution level of urban lake sediments in China was higher than that of the selected five typical non-urban lakes, and the problem of nitrogen pollution in sediments was more prominent. There was no significant difference in the potential risk assessment of HMs between urban lakes and typical non-urban lakes, but the probability of negative biological effects was significant. The surface sediments from the estuaries of the tributaries flowing downtowns and heavy industrial parks showed high heavy metal pollution levels and potential ecological risk. The HM pollution and environmental risk assessment of the sediments from urban lakes is of great significance. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",

The synergic effect of various threats may adversely affect and reduce the capacity of these riparian ecosystems to resilience, even though they have specific adaptations for living in extreme conditions. These diversity-rich riparian ecosystems provide critical ecological services such as influencing environmental processes, acting as habitats for both terrestrial and aquatic biota, and supporting the livelihood of the surrounding community. Hence the restoration of such damaged ecosystems is highly significant. This article presents a scheme for sustainable restoration of the disturbed riparian ecosystems with the involvement of multi-stakeholders. The three-stage scheme ensures the support and livelihood of the local community, along with the ecological restoration of riparian ecosystems using nature-based solutions with a scientific approach.

       " 'Purpose: In urban areas, soil functions are deeply impacted by all human activities, e.g., water infiltration, carbon storage, and chemical substances degradation potential. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) are assumed to deliver multiple environmental benefits for soil quality improvement. The H2020 Nature4Cities project (N4C) offers the framework to develop physical, chemical, and microbiological indicators to the performance assessment for addressing NBS soil quality (performance assessment of soil quality) to be included in a tool-box designed for architects or municipalities. Materials and methods: A simplified performance assessment methodology was developed for addressing NBS soil quality. It is based on the comparison of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics to soil reference baseline. In this setting, we present here the results obtained from case studies selected in three European cities (Nantes (F), Nancy (F), Bustehrad (CR)) to test the methodology. The case studies correspond to three different NBSs: former market turned into gardening areas (FMG), green roofs (GR), and urban allotment gardens (UAG). The performance assessment was based on two criteria: (1) soil fertility and (2) soil contamination. Results and discussion: The basic soil properties (e.g., pH, bulk density) and soil fertility (e.g., soil organic matter (SOM)) for the two open soil NBS (FMG and UAGs) are equivalent to cultivated soils. Those of GR are highly controlled by the type of natural materials used in the substrate. Concerning contamination, the soil quality of FMG was shown to be significantly impacted by former agricultural practices (pesticide residues, trace metals (TE)). Measured molecular biomass of FMG was compared with predictive molecular biomass (determined according to the soil physicochemical properties). Data showed that 12 of the 14 measured plots are classified as altered or very altered soils with regard to this parameter. TE in UAGs soils exhibit various concentrations, depending on former land use, cultural practices, and geological contexts. Conclusions: In conclusion, the study showed that soil fertility is a rather interesting tool in the evaluation of urban soil quality. Nevertheless, basic soil properties seem to be influenced by the effects of trace element and pesticide contamination. The presence of NBSs seems to have a favorable impact (e.g., filtration of pollutants). Inappropriate management of urban soils can lead to a decrease in soil quality and thus influence the current major issues (e.g., carbon sequestration, contamination of urban spaces by organic, and inorganic pollutants). © 2020, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Coastal communities are increasingly vulnerable to climate change and its effects may push coastal ecosystems to undergo irreversible changes. This is especially true for shorebirds with the loss of biodiversity and resource-rich habitats to rest, refuel, and breed. To protect these species, it is critical to conduct research related to nature-based Solutions (NbS). Through a scoping review of scientific literature, this paper initially identified 85 articles with various ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies that could help conserve shorebird populations and promote ecotourism. Of these 85 articles, 28 articles had EbA strategies that were examined, with some like coral reefs and mangroves eliminated as they were inappropriate for this region. The scoping review identified four major EbA strategies for the Greater Niagara Region with living shorelines and beach nourishment being the most suitable, especially when combined. These strategies were then evaluated against the eight core principles of nature-based solutions protecting shorebird as well as human wellbeing. Living shoreline strategy was the only one that met all eight NbS principles. As the coastline of the region greatly varies in substrate and development, further research will be needed to decide which EbA strategies would be appropriate for each specific area to ensure their efficacy. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'This systematic review examines the importance of a systems/holistic approach in analyzing and addressing the footprints/impacts of business-as-usual activities regarding the development of a circular economy (CE). Recent works on why current CE approaches have to be examined in terms of reductionist vs. systems perspectives are reviewed to tackle questions pertaining to the right or the wrong way of CE implementation. ‘Doing the right thing right’ is essential for sustainability-the ultimate goal of a CE, which must be viewed as a system to begin with. The limited reductionist approach overlooks and thus cannot prognosticate on the formidable unintended consequences that emerge from ‘doing the right things wrong’, consequences that become too costly to undo. The systems approach, being holistic, is complicated and difficult to pursue but open to exciting opportunities to integrate innovations in CE analysis and implementation. Complexity is an inherent downside of the systems approach. However, both approaches are complementary, as reductionist models can be combined to create a system of comprehensive analysis to correct the approach towards implementation of current CE initiatives. This review reports that advancements in systems analytical frameworks and tools are highly important for creating general guidelines on CE analysis and implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The Meghna river estuary has had substantial importance in supporting the coastal community’s livelihood for decades, but the pressure on it is immense due to many anthropogenic drivers. The present study aimed to assess its ecosystem services (ES) according to the framework of the standard international classification of ecosystem services (CICES). This study also identified the drivers, pressure, state, impact, and responses (DPSIR), and the factors responsible for ES changes in the Meghna river estuarine ecosystems. By merging both quantitative and qualitative data, a total of 19 sub-categories of ES were found, among which eight are provisioning, seven are regulatory, and four are cultural services, according to the CICES framework. From the results, it can be concluded that food provisioning from the Hilsha fishery, the national fish as a part of cultural heritage, and nursery habitat functions were the top provisional, regulatory, and cultural services to the society in the study areas and beyond. However, several threats and stressors of both anthropogenic and natural origins were identified as drivers of ES changes, such as overexploitation, destructive and illegal fishing, heavy river bed siltation, and natural hazards such as extreme cyclonic events, floods, and sea levels rising. This study underlines the urgency of research and policy attention to address the challenges, and of transforming management regimes to an ecosystem-based approach, which is part of nature-based solutions according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which refers to the present case, and particularly to fishery co-management. Creating alternative income sources and raising community awareness regarding the importance of maintaining the healthy condition of the river basins, and comprehensive compliance with the rules and regulations are proposed in order to ensure these estuarine ecosystems’ sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The growing interest in climate change and related risks has triggered efforts to address both its causes and impact. Climate action is mainstreamed in various public policies in which spatial planning has a key role and operates as a coordinating framework as well as one that enables specific interventions. At the same time, land, an indispensable element of spatial planning, is gaining attention as a natural resource that is closely related to climate change. Increasing need for land protection raises the need for a renewed role of spatial planning of all types and levels. This paper examines issues of land protection related to climate change in a peri-urban area of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area in Greece and seeks to identify how the types of spatial planning contribute to land protection. It is argued that when viewing land protection from a climate adaptation perspective, a renewed relationship between the types and levels of spatial planning that demands emphasis be placed on their cooperation and the enabling of novel approaches such as nature-based solutions becomes apparent. © 2021 by the author.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NbS) provide direct benefits to people who live in areas where these approaches are present. The degree of direct benefits (thermal comfort, reduced flood risk, and mental health) varies across temporal and spatial scales, and it can be modelled and quantified. Less clear are the indirect benefits related to opportunities to learn about the environment and its influence on personal behaviour and action. The present study, based on survey data from 1955 participants across 17 cities worldwide, addressed whether participation in NbS through two types of interactions (a passive learning experience about NbS and a more active experience based on Citizen Science) stimulates motivation and willingness to be more environmentally sustainable. Over 75% of participants improved their understanding of environmental sustainability and were highly motivated and more confident in their ability to improve sustainability in their local environment/nature. Similar percentage improvements arose from both types of activity across all cities. Those NbS that had elements of both blue and green infrastructure rated higher than those that had predominantly green NbS. Interestingly, a large percentage of the participants did not live near the NbS that were the focus of these activities. This indicated that expected spatial limitations between benefit and recipient may be overcome when dedicated programmes involve people in learning or monitoring NbS. Therefore, opportunities have arisen to expand inclusion from the immediately local to the larger community through participation and Citizen Science, with potential benefits to social cohesion and urban sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Global health emergencies such as Covid-19 have highlighted the importance of access to nature and open spaces in our cities for social, physical, and mental health. However, there continues to be a disconnect between our need for nature and our daily lived experience. Recent research indicates that our connectedness and relationship with nature, and in particular biophilic design, may be key for improving both health and quality of life. Rather than relying on abstract universal ideas of “nature”, using evidence-based biophilic design and policy at a building, neighborhood, and city scale, to link our daily lives with biodiversity, may encourage sense of place and make environmental action more meaningful. Then, improving our natural capital in the urban built environment might help address the current climate and disease crisis, as well as improving our physical and mental health. Drawing from emerging research and innovative practice, the paper describes key research and design paradigms that influence the way we understand the benefits of nature for different environments, including the workplace, neighborhood, and city, and explains where biophilic design theory sits in this field. Examples from recent research carried out in London and Chicago are provided, aiming at demonstrating what kind of research can be functional to what context, followed by a detailed analysis of its application supporting both human and ecological health. The study concludes indicating key policy and design lessons learned around regenerative design and biophilia as well as new directions for action, particularly with regard to climate change, sense of place, and well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Coastal wetlands represent particularly valuable natural resources, characterized by the interaction between their geomorphological and biological components. Their adaptation to the changing conditions depends on the rate and extent of spatial and temporal processes and their response is still not fully understood.

Landsat satellite imagery is used to delineate the spatial and temporal variability of the main vegetation and sediment typologies in 1990–2011. Within this period, specific anthropic activities were carried out for morphological restoration and flood protection interventions. Specifically, the lower saltmarsh shows its more fragmented part in the Baccan islet, a residual sandy spit in front of the Lido inlet. The area covered by Sarcocornia-Limonium, that triggers sediment deposition, has fluctuated yearly, from a minimum coverage of 13% to a maximum of 50%. The second decade (2001–2009) is identified as the period with major changes of halophytic and Algae-Biofilm cover typologies distribution. The power law and related thresholds, representing the patch size frequency distribution, is an indicator of the ecosystem state transition dynamics. The approach, based on multi-temporal and spatial EO analysis, is scalable elsewhere, from regional to local-to-global scale, considering the variability of climate data and anthropogenic activities. The present research also supports sustainable habitat management, improving the detection, and optimizing the offer of EO products for coastal system monitoring. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Urban heat islands are characterized by the increased temperature in urban areas compared with the rural surroundings due to human-made interventions that replace natural lands with buildings and roads. This study focuses on the assessment and utilization of using local nature-based solutions such as trees, sensitive landscaping types and design strategies to enhance microclimate in neighborhood streets and the public realm in desert areas, taking Abu Dhabi as a case study. The research utilizes a design-based approach to propose landscaping and layouts of urban street trees in low-rise residential urban areas. In this study, two methods namely an on-site measurement using citizen science, and a numerical simulation model in the ENVI-met software are used. Site-measurements included the tree physical characteristics such as tree height, crown width (crown spread/diameter), and trunk height, and the use of technology (photography and the Fulcrum mobile application, Nikon Forestry pro Laser Rangefinder) and air temperature around trees. ENVI-met included four scenarios: 1—“no-vegetation”, 2—“grass-only”, 3—“existing conditions” and 4—“proposed landscape design”. Grass and three types of local street trees are used in the proposed scenarios including Ghaf, Poinciana, and Temple tree. In addition, a standard of 6 and 8 m spacing between each tree is applied to determine the effect of varying vegetation densities on the outdoor temperature. The combined results using citizen science and the model allowed the identification of particular urban tree species that show substantial cooling effects. This is the case of Poinciana trees, which decreased the air temperature up to 0.9◦C when spaced every six meters in pathways and open unshaded areas amongst alleys, improving the overall thermal conditions in neighborhoods of hot-arid landscapes. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Halophytes are salt-tolerant plants that can be used to extract dissolved inorganic nutrients from saline aquaculture effluents under a production framework commonly known as Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA). Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen (common name: Sea purslane) is an edible saltmarsh halophyte traditionally consumed by humans living near coastal wetlands and is considered a promising extractive species for IMTA. To better understand its potential for IMTA applications, the present study investigates how artificial lighting and plant density affect its productivity and capacity to extract nitrogen and phosphorous in hydroponic conditions that mimic aquaculture effluents. Plant growth was unaffected by the type of artificial lighting employed-white fluorescent lights vs. blue-white LEDs-but LED systems were more energy-efficient, with a 17% reduction in light energy costs. Considering planting density, high-density units of 220 plants m-2 produced more biomass per unit of area (54.0-56.6 g m-2 day-1) than did low-density units (110 plants m-2; 34.4-37.1 g m-2 day-1) and extracted more dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. Overall, H. portulacoides can be easily cultivated hydroponically using nutrient-rich saline effluents, where LEDs can be employed as an alternative to fluorescent lighting and high-density planting can promote higher yields and extraction efficiencies. © 2021 by the authors.

According to experts from different countries, LID technologies were mostly used for their hydraulic performance. However, few other countries also used LID technologies due to its pollutant removal capabilities.

       " 'The positive influence of urban green spaces on human health and well-being is well known while the pathways are little understood. Past research has largely focused on visual stimuli, yet the auditory pathway is also an important means for contact with nature. The sonic environments of urban green spaces, however, are rarely entirely natural and many differ in their composition of natural sounds and anthropogenic noise. Few studies have investigated how these differences may impact the restorative potential of these soundscapes and, in particular, how the presence of traffic noise may constrain the benefits of natural sounds. To address this gap, we examined differences in the perceived restorativeness and perceived restorative outcomes across a gradient of eight park soundscapes that differed in bird and traffic sounds. In a laboratory setting, 162 participants listened to sound samples and reported on perceptions of the soundscapes and restorative potential and outcomes. The results strongly indicate that park soundscapes with a rich array of perceived bird sounds and minimal perceived traffic noise offer the greatest perceived restoration. Traffic noise was found to moderate the positive effect of bird sounds. The duration of time lived in the city and noise sensitivity were also positively associated with greater perceived restorative benefits while noise-sensitive people were also more negatively affected by traffic noise. The promotion of highly natural soundscapes in urban green spaces and the reduction of traffic noise can provide nature-based solutions to human health and well-being in urban areas.

       " 'Vegetation can be used as a nature-based solution (NBS) to restore rivers and mitigate water-triggered processes along streambanks. Roots are well known to improve the overall stability of slopes through hydro-mechanical reinforcement within the rooted zone. Vegetation-based solutions require the selection of species that are most suitable for specific locations, and they are aimed at restoring the natural state and function of river systems in support of biodiversity, flood management, and landscape development. Selecting a combination of different species along different zones of the riverbank can improve the conditions for the river system with regard to biodiversity and stability. Therefore, more studies are needed to investigate how the combination of a variety of different plant species can improve the stability of the riverbank. This paper presents a methodological approach for slope stability modeling including vegetation as well as the results obtained from a series of slope stability calculations adopting the proposed methodology. The analyses were carried out for critical shallow (≤3 m deep) shear planes of ideal benchmark slopes covered with four different plant combinations—(i) only grass, (ii) grass and shrubs, (iii) only trees, and (iv) trees, shrubs, and grass—for species typically found along streams in southeastern Norway. In this desk study, two types of tree species were selected, namely Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Downy birch (Betula pubescens). The Goat willow (Salix caprea) was selected as a shrub, while a common mixed-grass was chosen as grass. Vegetation features were obtained from the literature. The methodology was used for two main cases: (1) considering only the mechanical contribution of vegetation and (2) considering both the hydrological and mechanical reinforcement of vegetation. The main outcome of the numerical modeling showed that the purely mechanical contribution of vegetation to slope stability could not be decoupled from the hydrological reinforcement in order to have a realistic assessment of the roots improvement to the stability. The most critical shear surfaces occurred below the rooted zone in all cases, and the best performance was obtained using the combinations including trees. Considering the typical climate conditions in Norway, the hydro-mechanical reinforcement was most effective in the spring and for combinations including low height vegetation (i.e., grass and shrubs). The study concludes that a mixed combination of vegetation (trees, shrubs, and grass) is the most suitable for reaching the highest hydro-mechanical reinforcement of streambanks, together with erosion protection and boosting the ecosystem biodiversity. The current study can help practitioners determine which vegetation cover combination is appropriate for improving the current stability of a streambank with restoration practices. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'This paper describes the greening of ash dumps from two thermal power plants located in Romania, in the villages of Mintia and Doices, ti, two rural areas neighboring middle-sized cities, both with architectural, archaeological and landscape heritage. Currently, the two Romanian villages have different fates in the context of shrinking cities, and solutions from the industrialized country of Germany that are more advanced in closing polluting thermal power plants are examples of this. Thus, the greening of industrial waste is one of the current challenges of the energy shift towards renewable energy. Nature-based solutions such as the proposed use of the biodegradable geo-textile in the greening is one of the current trends. The development of the biodegradable geotextile was contemporary with the creation of the International Building Exhibition (Internationale Bauaaustellung-IBA) Emscher Park in the ancient industrial coal mining Ruhr area, in Germany; later research, around 10 years ago, explored soil pollution at these two Romanian thermal power plants. A recent research study investigated the conversion of the industrial buildings of the thermal power plant in Doices, ti, however, these buildings were demolished at the end of last year. Mintia thermal power plant continues to function. This paper explores the current challenges of industrial brownfields, energy shift, ecology, the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris and “Laudato si”, spanning 30 years of history and the legacy of the research over this time. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) are an innovative concept that mimics the processes of natural ecosystems, popularized principally in the European Union. With a substantial body of literature amassed since the term’s inception in 2015, there is a need to systematically review existing literature to identify overarching gaps and trends, according to disciplinary focus, geographic scope, and key themes, and direct future research inquiry and policy recommendations. This review consists of bibliometric analysis and thematic analysis for NBS studies in urbanism. NBS studies were found to relate strongly with other concepts of ‘Ecosystem Services’, ‘Green Infrastructure’, ‘Climate Change’, and ‘Risk management and Resilience’, which align with four major thematic goals set by the European Commission. Within NBS scholarship, various sub-themes have emerged, namely, ‘Greening’, ‘Urban Development’, ‘Water’, ‘Wellbeing’, and ‘Governance’. Furthermore, we illustrate that the amount and thematic focus of NBS research have been unevenly distributed worldwide. Analysis of emerging trends shows a recent increase in topics, such as adaptive governance of NBS, and the incorporation of social justice in sustainability transitions. Based on an assessment of extant NBS literature, we offer some recommendations for the future direction of the research fields. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) are being deployed around the world in order to address hydrometeorological hazards, including flooding, droughts, landslides and many others. The term refers to techniques inspired, supported and copied from nature, avoiding large constructions and other harmful interventions. In this work the development and evaluation of an NBS applied to the Spercheios river basin in Central Greece is presented. The river is susceptible to heavy rainfall and bank overflow, therefore the intervention selected is a natural water retention measure that aims to moderate the impact of flooding and drought in the area. After the deployment of the NBS, we examine the benefits under current and future climate conditions, using various climate change scenarios. Even though the NBS deployed is small compared to the rest of the river, its presence leads to a decrease in the maximum depth of flooding, maximum velocity and smaller flooded areas. Regarding the subsurface/groundwater storage under current and future climate change and weather conditions, the NBS construction seems to favor long-term groundwater recharge. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'A need for multi-functional assessment tools evaluating trade-offs and co-benefits for various types of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) has been increasingly identified in recent years. Methodologically, concepts for a tool are presented which include quantifying the demand and potential for NBS to enhance ecosystem service (ES) provision, and linking ESs to readily quantifiable and legislatively-relevant environmental quality indicators (EQIs). The objective of tool application is to identify optimal NBS placement across a diverse set of socio-environmental indicators, whilst also incorporating issues of relative location of areas of implementation and benefit accrual. Embedded within the tool is the importance of evaluating outcomes in terms of economic benefits and of sustainable development goals. The concepts are illustrated with simplified examples, relating to the case of implementing urban forestry as an exemplar NBS. By summarising the knowledge base it is demonstrated that benefits of NBS are substantially scale-dependent in two main respects; those of extent and proximity to receptors. Evaluation tools should be capable of quantifying scale-dependence. The substantive importance of these considerations and how their dynamics vary between indicators and services is illustrated graphically through schematic functions. When developed, the tool should be used as a focus for consultation and co-design to pinpoint the size of NBS necessary to achieve a sufficient level of benefit for a particular receptor. This could be measured against target levels of benefit for each indicator, distinguishing between primary intended outcomes and those co-benefits or trade-offs that are secondary or unintended. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'Trophic rewilding provides a nature-based solution for biological conservation; however, empirical studies demonstrating rewilding effects are limited. Megaherbivores moderate the type and quality of habitat available to other fauna. However, these effects may take time to develop. Further, fauna responses to megaherbivore rewilding will depend on a suite of life-history traits and strategies that allow persistence within megaherbivore modified landscapes. We conducted a space-for-time field survey in South African savanna to determine if habitat modifications mediated by a reintroduced megaherbivore, the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana), impacts the abundance of the diurnal arboreal cape dwarf gecko (Lygodactylus capensis) and two generalist diurnal skinks [the variable skink (Trachylepis varia) and striped skink (Trachylepis striata), collectively] across a 47-year period. The relative abundance of lizards and six habitat attributes utilized by lizards were assessed at 30 sites stratified across three biophysically and climatically similar nature reserves with different elephant reintroduction times (no elephants, 2003, 1972). The arboreal gecko was less common at the reserve with an older reintroduction time than the other reserves and was most commonly observed on, and positively correlated with, the density of the corkwood tree (Commiphora mollis). The generalist skinks were common across all reserves and were observed in a variety of habitats. Our results suggest that elephant rewilding differently impacts lizard species with different life-history strategies and that these effects take prolonged periods to develop. Given such knowledge, a long-term understanding of post-rewilding interactions will be a key point when designing and assessing the success of rewilding initiatives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " \"Global sustainability targets demand transformative changes. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in science and policy, but their potential for transformative change remains unexplored. We provide a framework to evaluate how NbS contribute to transformative change and apply it to 93 NbS from mountain social-ecological systems (SES). The framework serves to assess what elements may catalyze transformative change, how transformative change occurs, and what its outcomes are. Our results show that NbS are as much “people based” as “nature based.” Most NbS are based on four elements with transformation potential: nature's values, knowledge types, community engagement, and nature management practices. Our results confirm the potential of NbS for transformative change, observed through changes in non-sustainable trajectories of SES. We illustrate the components of our framework through a novel classification of NbS. The framework provides key components for assessing the effectiveness of NbS and allows tracking long-term transformative change processes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.\",\n",
       " 'Constructed wetlands are a nature-based engineering solution enabling polishing of septic tank effluents at low-cost. However to date, the influence of planting on treatment efficiency remains little understood. Here we report a case study evaluating the performance of two near-identical Horizontal Sub-Surface Flow Constructed Wetlands (HSSF-CW) deployed at a school in southern India. The HSSF-CWs were of similar size and construction with the exception that one system was planted (Canna indica) whilst the other was operated without plants. Both systems were operated at similar hydraulic loading rate (HLR) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 84 mm day−1 and 3.7 days, respectively to treat the effluent from septic tanks. The systems were monitored fortnightly for one year and the performance kinetics, nutrient and organics removal efficiencies were evaluated. Significant reduction in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (p &lt; 0.05) were observed in both systems with BOD5 removal efficiency of 67% and 61% in the planted and unplanted systems, respectively. Whilst the effluent from both systems met the environmental discharge standards set by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India, the total phosphorus (TP) and total suspended solids (TSS) removal in the unplanted system were significantly greater than in the planted system. The first-order decay rate constants (K) obtained for TN (KTN) and BOD5 (KBOD5) in the planted system (0.16 day−1 and 0.30 day−1) were higher than in the unplanted system (0.09 day−1 and 0.27 day−1). Greater R2 values obtained for the planted system (~ 0.90) suggests applicability of a first-order decay model to assess contaminant degradation. Plants contributed to 7% (0.3 g/m2/day) BOD5, 18% (1.9 g/m2/day) COD and 5% (0.09 g/m2/day) TN load removal. Our data demonstrates that planting is effective in improving treatment efficiency in constructed wetlands, and whilst the improvement is marginal here, it is noted that a rust infection could have limited effectiveness of the plants in this case. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NbS)—solutions to societal challenges that involve working with nature—have recently gained popularity as an integrated approach that can address climate change and biodiversity loss, while supporting sustainable development. Although well-designed NbS can deliver multiple benefits for people and nature, much of the recent limelight has been on tree planting for carbon sequestration. There are serious concerns that this is distracting from the need to rapidly phase out use of fossil fuels and protect existing intact ecosystems. There are also concerns that the expansion of forestry framed as a climate change mitigation solution is coming at the cost of carbon rich and biodiverse native ecosystems and local resource rights. Here, we discuss the promise and pitfalls of the NbS framing and its current political traction, and we present recommendations on how to get the message right. We urge policymakers, practitioners and researchers to consider the synergies and trade-offs associated with NbS and to follow four guiding principles to enable NbS to provide sustainable benefits to society: (1) NbS are not a substitute for the rapid phase out of fossil fuels; (2) NbS involve a wide range of ecosystems on land and in the sea, not just forests; (3) NbS are implemented with the full engagement and consent of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in a way that respects their cultural and ecological rights; and (4) NbS should be explicitly designed to provide measurable benefits for biodiversity. Only by following these guidelines will we design robust and resilient NbS that address the urgent challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, sustaining nature and people together, now and into the future. © 2021 The Authors.

       " 'Urgent solutions to global climate change are needed. Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people. © 2021 Royal Botanic Garden, Kew.

       " 'The United Nations General Assembly declared 2021-2030 as the \"Decade of Ecosystem Restoration\", which positions \"the restoration of ecosystems as a major nature-based solution towards meeting a wide range of global development goals and national priorities\". Ecological restoration, when it was implemented effectively, contributes to improving food and water security, mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, boosting economic prosperity and benefiting human health and well-being. Thus, ecological restoration is fundamental for the success of ecological civilization and sustainable development. Ecological restoration theories in developed countries usually require restoring the ecosystem to the status prior to degradation, and this requirement is difficult to achieve in regions with serious degradation, especially in developing countries. We developed a new theory of ecological restoration, or stepwise ecological restoration (STERE), which comprises three modes in different restoration stages: Environmental remediation in the initial stage with serious degradation, ecological rehabilitation for moderately degraded ecosystems, and natural restoration for slightly degraded ecosystems. Environmental remediation aims to reduce environmental pollution through the removal or detoxification of pollutants or excess nutrients from soil and water. Ecological rehabilitation is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed through various physical, chemical and biological restoration strategies. Natural restoration aims to restore ecosystem functions and services and improve ecosystem resilience without much human assistance. Environmental remediation is fundamental and needs to be implemented prior to ecological rehabilitation and natural restoration in places where pollution is severe. Only the former is successfully carried out; however, when the ecosystem is moderately degraded, ecological rehabilitation can be effectively implemented. In places where the ecosystem is slightly degraded, natural restoration is recommended. The processes of ecological rehabilitation and natural restoration will result in ecological functions that are more complete, an increase in biodiversity, and improved ecosystem resilience. For STERE, appropriate restoration goals should be formulated based on the degree of degradation, local funding support, and technological development. The new theory proposed in this study emphasizes the application of reference ecosystems in restoration projects and the importance of ecological monitoring. It also requires an adaptive restoration management framework that considers the influence of global climate change. STERE should be implemented for future ecosystems rather than only for restoring an ecosystem to a status similar to the condition prior to degradation. Moreover, STERE promotes systematic large-scale landscape restoration by considering the interactions between individual small scales (e.g., field scale) and large scales (e.g., catchment scale). In addition, technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles and remote sensing should be more widely used in future STERE projects. Ecological restoration databases should be established for restorative activities in mountains, waters, forests, farms, lakes and other ecosystems. The newly proposed STERE theory would play an important role in developing restoration projects worldwide, especially in developing countries. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.',\n",
       " 'The interactive dynamics in the food, water, and energy system as a nexus (FWEN) are critical to the sustainable development of global cities, and they can be mediated by green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in the urban area. Here we provide a comprehensive literature review to examine how GBI affects FWEN in urban centers, an area which is currently understudied. In order to do this, we undertake a systematic review of the literature using a meta-analytic approach and topic modelling. Based on our synthesis, we develop a conceptual framework of the key links between urban GBI and FWEN and the direction and magnitude of the relationship. We found that GBIs can benefit food supply, energy saving, and climate change mitigation but at a price of food safety and water contamination. Well-designed urban construction can help curb the negative effects. Therefore, we need to make deliberate and integrative policy to link GBI with each element in urban FWEN. Moreover, the focus of studies on GBIFWEN links is also heterogeneous across cities: urban agriculture and food security are priorities in cities located in Africa and Asia as well as in lower income and larger cities (but not metropolitan areas), while the cooling effect of green space has been a focus for cities of middle or high income. Finally, current research focuses on isolated analysis, lacking integrated studies needed for decision making supporting tools. While isolated analyses lead to connectivity failures and can result in adverse impacts, integrated analyses can identify interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales, which can increase resource efficiency and minimize environmental degradation. Therefore, our key findings point out the importance of linking the effects of GBI on each component of FWEN in both research and policy making. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Urban areas are expanding due to rural-urban migration and due to population increases. Their resilience is being challenged due to socio-political consequences of increasingly frequent and severe storms, due to climate changes, influx of human and animal refugees and as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors prepared a systematic literature of ways cities can be transformed into more resilient, and sustainable regions by creatively enhancing the quality and quantity of blue and green areas in and around them. The literature review was conducted to provide holistic insights into selection, implementation monitoring, assessment, and valuation of Nature-based Solutions in diverse urban regions. The authors reviewed no fewer than 298 articles from 109 academic journals and related sources, published within 1997–2020. The focus of the articles was upon ‘nature-based’ changes that are being implemented in urban areas, globally to enhance their resilience and the ‘quality-of-life’ of humans and other species. By implementing nature-based solutions, and complimentary ‘urban wilding’ approaches, urban areas and their hinterlands are expanding their ‘blue’ and ‘green’ areas and are thereby decreasing the ‘heat-island’ effects, while improving human health by surrounding them with rich bio-diversities of locally adapted, aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals. Although, many NBS options have been documented to be beneficial, their environmental, economic and social/psychological dimensions have not been adequately quantified, especially in the context of climate changes, and with regard to COVID-19. It is essential that the benefits of NBS are quantified with easily measurable outcomes, that are readily understood by practitioners, city policy-makers and members of community organizations, based upon specific geographical and climatological contexts. This will help them accelerate implementation of NBS and wilding into their urban systems. The reviewers found that more research is needed on anticipatory learning, backcasting and community participation to help to effectively implement the appropriate NBS for improving the sustainability of urban systems. The reviewers provide guidance for urban leaders to incorporate NBS into their policies and strategies to improve urban resilience and equity and to more effectively reduce impacts of climate change, population growth and pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Riparian zones form a boundary between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, with disproportionate influences on food web dynamics and ecosystem functioning in both habitats. However, riparian boundaries are frequently degraded by human activities, including urbanization, leading to direct impacts on terrestrial communities and indirect changes that are mediated through altered connectivity with adjacent aquatic ecosystems. We investigated how riparian habitat influences fish communities in an urban context. We electrofished nine urban site pairs with and without forested riparian buffers, alongside an additional 12 sites that were located throughout the river networks in the Oslo Fjord basin, Norway. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) were the dominant fish species. Riparian buffers had weak positive effects on fish densities at low to moderate levels of catchment urbanization, whereas fish were absent from highly polluted streams. Subtle shifts in fish size distributions suggested that riparian buffers play an important role in metapopulation dynamics. Stable isotopes in fish from buffered reaches indicated dietary shifts, pointing to the potential for a greater reliance on terrestrial-sourced carbon. Combining these results, we postulate that spatially-mediated ontogenetic diet shifts may be important for the persistence of brown trout in urban streams. Our results show that using a food web perspective is essential in understanding how riparian buffers can offset impacts in urban catchments. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Flooding is a frequent, naturally recurring phenomenon worldwide that can become disastrous if not addressed accordingly. This paper aims to evaluate the impacts of land use change and climate change on flooding in the Segamat River Basin, Johor, Malaysia, with 1D–2D hydrodynamic river modeling, using InfoWorks Integrated Catchment Modeling (ICM). The study involved the development of flood maps for four different scenarios: (1) future land use in 2030; (2) the impacts of climate change; (3) three mitigation strategies comprising detention ponds, rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs), and permeable pavers; and (4) a combination of these three mitigation strategies. The obtained results show increases in the flood peaks under both the land use change and climate change scenarios. With the anticipated increase in development activities within the vicinity up to 2030, the overall impact of urbanization on the extent of flooding would be rather moderate, as the upper and middle parts of the basin would still be dominated by forests and agricultural activities (approximately 81.13%). In contrast, the potential flood‐inundated area is expected to increase from 12.25% to 16.64% under storms of 10‐, 50‐, 100‐, and 1000‐year average recurrence intervals (ARI). Interestingly, the simulation results suggest that only the detention pond mitigation strategy has a considerable impact on reducing floods, while the other two mitigation strategies have less flood reduction advantages for this agricultural‐based rural basin located in a tropical region. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The water storage capacity of a green roof generates several benefits for the building conterminous environment. The hydrologic performance is conventionally expressed by the runoff coefficient, according to international standards and guidelines. The runoff coefficient is a dimen-sionless number and defines the water retention performance over a long period. At the scale of single rain events, characterized by varying intensity and duration, the reaction of the green roof is scarcely investigated. The purpose of this study is to highlight how an extensive green roof—having a supposed minimum water performance, compared to an intensive one—responds to real and repet-itive rain events, simulated in a rain chamber with controlled rain and runoff data. The experiment provides, through cumulative curve graphs, the behavior of the green roof sample during four rainy days. The simulated rain events are based on a statistical study (summarized in the paper) of 25 years of rain data for a specific location in North Italy characterized by an average rain/year of 1100 mm. The results prove the active response of the substrate, although thin and mineral, and quick draining, in terms of water retention and detention during intense rain events. The study raises questions about how to better express the water performance of green roofs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'In 2010, Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, committing to conserve, by 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland waters and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas through systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). Once national data are updated it is expected that Parties will have met the coverage elements of Target 11, especially as more OECMs are reported. There is still, however, more effort needed to address equitable governance, effective management, ecological representation, connectivity and other quality elements of the target. Post-2020 momentum is growing to adopt more ambitious global targets of at least 30 per cent of terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems protected by 2030 to halt biodiversity loss. This will require a three-pronged approach: creating new protected areas focussed on areas important for biodiversity; improving management and governance to ensure that existing and new protected areas are effective; and recognising and supporting OECMs. The substantial expansion of protected areas over the last decade, new opportunities to recognise OECMs, and increasing recognition of effective protected and conserved areas as nature-based solutions to climate change and other global challenges, all give reasons for optimism for making even greater progress by 2030 towards the CBD 2050 Vision of Living in Harmony with Nature. © 2021, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

       " 'Rapid urbanization in many parts of the world has increasingly put the environment under pressure, with natural landscapes cleared to make way for built infrastructure. Urban ecosystems, and the services that they provide, can offer nature-based solutions to the challenges of urbanization. There is increasing interest in better incorporating ecosystems into urban planning and design in order to deliver greater provision of ecosystem services and enhance urban liveability. However, there are few examples of built or proposed urban developments that have been designed specifically with ecosystem services in mind–partly because there are few modeling tools available to support urban planners and designers by informing their design workflows. Through using Singapore’s latest nature-centric town as a case study, this article assesses the impacts of nature-based solutions in urban design on ecosystem services performance, through a spatially explicit modeling approach. The proposed future scenario for the nature-centric town was projected to result in substantial declines in the provision of all ecosystem services, as a result of the removal of large areas of natural vegetation cover. However, the future scenario compared favourably against three older towns that have been constructed in Singapore, showing the best performance for four out of six ecosystem services. This simulation exercise indicates that designing towns with ecosystem services in mind, and incorporating nature-based solutions into urban design, can help to achieve enhanced performance in providing ecosystem services. The models developed for this study have been made publicly available for use in other tropical cities. © Copyright © 2021 Tan, Gaw, Masoudi and Richards.',\n",
       " 'Urban green spaces are often promoted as nature-based solutions, thus helping to mitigate the negative effects of climate change. Estimating the potential environmental benefits provided by urban green space is difficult because of inconsistencies in management practices and their heterogeneous nature. Collecting data across such a spectrum of contexts at a large scale is costly and time consuming. In this study, we explore a novel integrated method for citizen scientists to assess the flood mitigation potential of urban green spaces. In three European cities, citizen scientists measured infiltration rate and associated soil characteristics in managed and unmanaged urban green spaces. The results show that simple citizen science-based measurements can indicate the infiltration potential (i.e., high vs. low) of soil at these sites. Infiltration rate was best predicted by measurements of soil compaction, soil color, air temperature, and level of insolation (i.e., high vs. low). These simple, fast methods can be repeated over time and space by citizen scientists to provide robust estimates of soil characteristics and the infiltration potential of soils that exist in similar temperate urban areas. A classification flow diagram was constructed and validated that allows citizen scientists to carry out such tests over a wider geographical region and at a higher frequency than would be available to research scientists alone. Most importantly, it allows citizens to take actions to improve infiltration in their local green space and support local flood resilience. © 2021 Pudifoot, Cárdenas, Buytaert, Paul, Narraway and Loiselle.',\n",
       " 'Among nature- based solutions (NBSs), green walls represent a key technology in the urban context because of the low energy demand and of the many ecological and social outcomes. This work presents the results of the experimental study at laboratory scale of the treatment of greywater (e.g. domestic wastewater excluding toilet flushes) through a green wall. It is made of two modular panels (1-set up for this study and 2-in use for 15 months), made of twelve pots arranged on four columns and three rows, and filled with a mix of coconut and perlite and different ornamental plant species. The green wall was fed discontinuously with 96 L/d of synthetic greywater for two months during the winter season. The treatment performances of the two panels were very high about total suspended solids (>87%), biological oxygen demand (>98%) and chemical oxygen demand (∼80%), in agreement with literature. Panel 1 exceeded the performances of panel 2 only about total suspended solids (96% vs 87%), probably because of a clogging phenomenon. This study proved the efficiency of green walls towards greywater treatment in challenging experimental conditions, as winter temperature and high hydraulic loading rate. © 2021 Patron Editore S.r.l..

       " 'How are our cities using nature‐based solutions to confront the challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and major resource depletion? This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and nature‐based solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of nature‐based solutions (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity de-cline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and self‐regulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in cities—big or small—all contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microcli-mate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens. The next step is to up‐scale citywide climate intervention strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors. © 2021 by the author.

       " 'This study aims to investigate the effect of two different groups of phenolic compounds (the alkylphenols nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP), and the chlorophenol pentachlorophenol (PCP)) on constructed wetlands (CWs) performance, including on organic matter, nutrients and contaminants removal efficiency, and on microbial community structure in the plant bed substrate. CWs were assembled at lab scale simulating a vertical flow configuration and irrigated along eight weeks with Ribeira de Joane (an urban stream) water not doped (control) or doped with a mixture of NP and OP or with PCP (at a 100 μg L-1 concentration each). The presence of the phenolic contaminants did not interfere in the removal of organic matter or nutrients in CWs in the long term. Removals of NP and OP were &gt;99%, whereas PCP removals varied between 87% and 98%, mainly due to biodegradation. Microbial richness, diversity and dominance in CWs substrate were generally not affected by phenolic compounds, with only PCP decreasing diversity. Microbial community structure, however, showed that there was an adaptation of the microbial community to the presence of each contaminant, with several specialist genera being enriched following exposure. The three more abundant specialist genera were Methylotenera and Methylophilus (methylophilaceae family) and Hyphomicrobium (hyphomicrobiaceae family) when the systems were exposed to a mixture of NP and OP. When exposed to PCP, the three more abundant genera were Denitromonas (Rhodocyclaceae family), Xenococcus_PCC_7305 (Xenococcaceae family) and Rhodocyclaceae_uncultured (Rhodocyclaceae family). To increase CWs efficiency in the elimination of phenolic compounds, namely PCP which was not totally removed, strategies to stimulate (namely biostimulation) or increase (namely bioaugmentation) the presence of these bacteria should be explore. This study clearly shows the potential of vertical flow CWs for the removal of phenolic compounds, a still little explored subject, contributing to promote the use of CWs as nature-based solutions to remediate water contaminated with different families of persistent and/or emergent contaminants. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The adoption of Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) represents a novel means to mitigate natural hazards. In the framework of the OPERANDUM project, this study introduces a methodology to assess the efficiency of the NBSs and a series of Open-Air Laboratories (OALs) regarded as a proof-of-concept for the wider uptake of NBSs. The OALs are located in Finland, Greece, UK, Italy, and Ireland. The methodology is based on a wide modeling activity, incorporated in the context of future climate scenarios. Herein, we present a series of models’ chains able to estimate the efficiency of the NBSs. While the presented models are mainly well-established, their coupling represents a first fundamental step in the study of the long-term efficacy and impact of the NBSs. In the selected sites, NBSs are utilized to cope with distinct natural hazards: floods, droughts, landslides, salt intrusion, and nutrient and sediment loading. The study of the efficacy of NBSs to mitigate these hazards belongs to a series of works devoted to the implementation of NBSs for environmental purposes. Our findings prove that land management plays a crucial role in the process. Specifically, the selected NBSs include intensive forestry; the conversion of urban areas to grassland; dunes; marine seagrass; water retention ponds; live cribwalls; and high-density plantations of woody vegetation and deep-rooted herbaceous vegetation. The management of natural resources should eventually consider the effect of NBSs on urban and rural areas, as their employment is becoming widespread. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) were almost unknown in Spain two decades ago; today, urban drainage in the country is transitioning towards a more sustainable and regenerative management in a global context where green policies are gaining prominence. This research establishes a diagnosis of SUDS in Spain and examines the extent to which the country is moving towards the new paradigm in three dimensions: (a) the governance and social perception of the community, (b) the regulative background, and (c) the implementation and the technical performance of SUDS. The diagnosis identifies barriers that hinder the change. Then, we define the challenges that Spain has to face to overcome obstacles that delay the transition. Barriers to the governance sphere are related to the lack of involvement, knowledge, and organisational responsibilities. Within the regulative framework, the absence of national standards hinders the general implementation at the national scale, although few regional and local authorities are taking steps in the right direction with their own regulations. From the technical perspective, SUDS performance within the Spanish context was determined, although some shortcomings are still to be investigated. Despite the slowdown caused by the hard recession periods and the more recent political instability, SUDS implementation in Spain is today a fact, and the country is close to reaching the stabilisation stage. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'In recent years, both mapping and assessing urban Ecosystem Services (ESs) to support urban planning has been a topic of great debate. This work aims at contributing to this discussion by developing and testing a methodological approach to first assess and map supply and demand of ESs, and then identify areas of priority of intervention. Starting from the existing models, the work develops a tailored approach to map and assess three ESs (water retention and runoff, PM10 removal, and carbon sequestration and storage) that are tested in the city of Bologna and tailored according to available open data. All data are processed in a GIS environment to allow for spatial distribution and visualization of ESs. These maps facilitate defining supply and demands and, con-sequently, the presence and distribution of ESs deficiencies. Building on mismatches, this paper proposes four clusters by grouping the city’s districts based on predominant land use (built‐up, green urban areas) and tree canopy cover. This classification enabled the identification of intervention priority areas and suggestions of relevant nature‐based solutions (NBS) to be implemented. The proposed method can serve other urban areas to perform a rapid assessment of their current needs and challenges in terms of ES provision. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) have emerged as an important concept to build climate resilience in cities whilst providing a wide range of ecological, economic, and social co-benefits. With the ambition of increasing NBS uptake, diverse actors have been developing means to demonstrate and prove these benefits. However, the multifunctionality, the different types of benefits provided, and the context-specificity make it difficult to capture and communicate their overall value. In this paper, a value-based framework is presented that allows for structured navigation through these issues with the goal of identifying key values and engaging beneficiaries from the public, private, and civil society sector in the development of NBS. Applied methods such as focus groups, interviews, and surveys were used to assess different framework components and their interlinkages, as well as to test its applicability in urban planning. Results suggest that more specialized “hard facts” might be needed to actually attract larger investments of specific actors. However, the softer and more holistic approach could inspire and support the forming of alliances amongst a wider range of urban stakeholders and the prioritization of specific benefits for further assessment. Consequently, it is argued that both hard and soft approaches to nature valuation will be necessary to further promote and drive the uptake of NBS in cities. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The natural capital and ecosystem services concepts describe the multiple benefits people get from nature. Urbanisation has been identified as one of the key factors influencing the decline of natural capital globally. Urbanisation has also been associated with a recent increase in urban flooding incidents in most cities globally. While the understanding of blue-green infrastructure in urban drainage is well established, little is said about its influence on natural capital. This study utilises the Natural Capital Planning Tool, Benefits Evaluation of Sustainable Drainage Systems tool and expert stakeholder interviews to assess the influence of blue-green and grey infrastructure as adaptation pathways in urban drainage, on natural capital and ecosystem services, and to determine how these contribute to other forms of human-derived capital. Key findings show that blue-green options can enhance natural capital and ecosystem services such as amenity value while also con-tributing to social and human capital. Although the assessed blue-green options contribute to reg-ulating ecosystem services such as floods regulation, their most significant contribution is in cultural ecosystem services, especially amenity value. It is concluded that incorporating blue-green infrastructure in urban drainage adaptive approaches can mitigate natural capital losses and contribute to other forms of capital crucial for human well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Urban green infrastructure (GI) approach supports building resilience, mitigating greenhouse gases emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change. However, the development and maintenance of GI in semi-arid cities can be hindered by limitations such as available water resources. In this article, we study priority areas for GI development schemes at the neighbourhood scale through a seasonal vulnerability framework with the case study of two urban districts in the semi-arid city of Tehran, Iran. Heat mitigation and stormwater runoff control are considered as the main objectives of GI development. The results show that priority areas have high levels of land surface temperature, impervious surfaces and population density, with a low proportion of vegetation land cover. The necessary GI services vary in different local climate zones (LCZ) during the year. Although heat mitigation is required in both compact and open LCZs, the runoff control service of GI is also needed for neighbourhoods with compact midrise settings. To promote sustainability at the neighbourhood scale, the findings of the study can be used for initiating nature-based solutions and GI development projects. © 2021 National Institute of Urban Affairs.',\n",
       " 'Payments for ecosystem services (PES) are increasingly promoted as nature-based solutions to climate, environmental, and business challenges. While participation in PES schemes is mandated in countries such as China, Costa Rica, and Vietnam, it remains unclear how PES schemes emerge in countries devoid of national mandates. This article investigates how actors have attempted institutional change to enable PES, by reinterpreting or adapting national laws, policies, and plans. We present an analytical framework theorising how geographical variations in (1) institutional frameworks, and (2) actor capabilities, dictate which institutions actors attempt to change. We then apply this framework to multi-scalar actors and institutions in Thailand and the Philippines. Our empirics reveal the types of institutional work that actors perform such as advocacy, education, mimicry, and networking, and demonstrate how this creates legal and discursive support, and improves stakeholder awareness and acceptance of PES as an environmental management strategy. Eight formal institutions are shown to have undergone change to enable PES across these countries, including those related to indigenous people, energy production, protected areas, pollution control, carbon offsetting, and decentralised governance. We show institutional change to be a geographical and contextual process that requires actors to match the right types of institutional work, with the right mechanism of institutional change, and a suitable target institution if they are to be successful in effecting change. Yet, we also report failed attempts, and explain how informal cultural norms act as challenges to formal institutional change. Through our comparative analysis of multiple institutions, actors, and national settings, we identify trends and make recommendations with global relevance to PES scholars and practitioners, and that can aid other initiatives that seek to address climate change and promote environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Increasing urban tree cover is an often proposed mitigation strategy against urban heat as trees are expected to cool cities through evapotranspiration and shade provision. However, trees also modify wind flow and urban aerodynamic roughness, which can potentially limit heat dissipation. Existing studies show a varying cooling potential of urban trees in different climates and times of the day. These differences are so far not systematically explained as partitioning the individual tree effects is challenging and impossible through observations alone. Here, we conduct numerical experiments removing and adding radiation, evapotranspiration, and aerodynamic roughness effects caused by urban trees using a mechanistic urban ecohydrological model. Simulations are presented for four cities in different climates (Phoenix, Singapore, Melbourne, Zurich) considering the seasonal and diurnal cycles of air and surface temperatures. Results show that evapotranspiration of well-watered trees alone can decrease local 2 m air temperature at maximum by 3.1– 5.8 °C in the four climates during summer. Further cooling is prevented by stomatal closure at peak temperatures as high vapour pressure deficits limit transpiration. While shading reduces surface temperatures, the interaction of a non-transpiring tree with radiation can increase 2 m air temperature by up to 1.6 – 2.1 °C in certain hours of the day at local scale, thus partially counteracting the evapotranspirative cooling effect. Furthermore, in the analysed scenarios, which do not account for tree wind blockage effects, trees lead to a decrease in urban roughness, which inhibits turbulent energy exchange and increases air temperature during daytime. At night, single tree effects are variable likely due to differences in atmospheric stability within the urban canyon. These results explain reported diurnal, seasonal and climatic differences in the cooling effects of urban trees, and can guide future field campaigns, planning strategies, and species selection aimed at improving local microclimate using urban greenery. © 2020 The Author(s)',\n",
       " \"Cities provide a locus for sustainability: they will soon accommodate most of the world's population, just as increasing environmental and climate emergencies and socio-economic inequalities constitute major challenges. The concept of urban green infrastructure (UGI) offers a greenspace planning approach based on a grounded set of principles to improve the environmental health and liveability of cities. A wide variety of greenspace planning and implementation approaches is already being applied within and across countries. This paper employs UGI as a research lens to critically evaluate planning trends in Slovakia on national, regional and local levels. To this end we have analysed planning documents, interviewed greenspace agents and evaluated local good practice. Our results indicate weak instrumental support for UGI planning, as well as other systemic and procedural barriers to green infrastructure. Moreover, a comparison with observations from other European planning systems reveals notable commonalities and differences. The paper then discusses a local greening programme and bottom-up actions as potential ways to foster green infrastructure development. Local practitioners can initiate important planning processes by employing nature-based practices, engaging with stakeholders and promoting functional approaches. We propose a participatory integrated model that utilises the opportunities embedded in bottom-up actions. Our model can be adopted in higher-level planning and policymaking if appropriate operational and mediating interventions take place. © 2021 The Author(s)\",\n",
       " 'Extensive afforestation is currently being widely promoted as a key nature-based solution for climate change mitigation. Fundamental to this strategy is the sequestration of carbon into long-term stable storage, either in wood products or the soil. However, the long-term effects of tree planting on soil carbon, or other soil properties, has rarely been examined. Importantly, afforestation can take many different forms, with differing effects on soil properties. Here, we evaluate how the historical afforestation of sandy heathland adopting a range of management options – including different combinations of conifers and broadleaves in monocultures and mixtures – have affected soil pH, total carbon and nitrogen concentrations, the C:N ratio, and carbon and nitrogen stocks almost a century later. We analyse these properties at a range of soil depths through the organic (litter, F and grass layers) and upper mineral (0–5 cm, 5–10 cm and 10–20 cm depth) soil layers. In comparison to the historical heathland sites, afforestation decreased soil pH, most dramatically under conifers, and increased the C:N ratio. However, there was overall little difference in carbon and nitrogen concentrations between alternative management options. While the total carbon and nitrogen concentrations were much higher in the organic layers of the forest options compared to the open sites, this did not translate into differences in the mineral layers. Furthermore, although we found some evidence of the transferral of carbon and nitrogen into the uppermost soil mineral layers, this was minimal in comparison to the concentrations of the organic layers. The soils at our study site are low quality and sandy, and are therefore unfavourable for incorporating organic matter, but it is still notable how little was incorporated after nearly a century of afforestation. Given the current emphasis on tree planting as a means to tackle climate change, these results demonstrate the fundamental importance of the appropriate consideration of both the afforestation management option and underlying soil type. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Zebra mussel cultivation efficiently traps highly bioavailable nutrients, thereby inverting the flux of nutrient from land to water, alleviating cultural eutrophication, and improving water quality. © 2020 The AuthorsWe studied the potential of zebra mussel farming for nutrient retention in a eutrophic lake. Duplicate experimental long-line cultivation units were deployed and mussel growth and nutrient retention were quantified after 28 months. Mussels grew well at shallow water depth (&lt;3 m) and our 625 m2 (lake area) experimental units produced 507 and 730 kg dry biomass, respectively, of which 94% were shells. These yields corresponded to an average retention of 92.7 ± 23.1 kg C, 6.1 ± 0.68 kg N, and 0.43 ± 0.04 kg P retention, or 742 kg C, 49 kg N, and 3.5 kg P for a full-size (0.5 ha) mussel farm. We estimate that concentrating the long-lines to a depth of 2.5 m would probably have doubled these yields, based on the differences in mussel growth among depths. We further estimate that a full-size cultivation unit (0.5 ha) thus could compensate for the annual total-P run-off from 23 ha, or the biologically available P from approximately 49 ha of agricultural soils. As traditional measures have proven insufficient, decision-makers need to facilitate novel approaches to mitigate the negative effects of cultural eutrophication. We envision that zebra mussel farming, within their invaded range, provides a promising approach to invert nutrient losses in lakes and coastal lagoons. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Vegetated biofiltration systems (biofilters) are now a well-established technology for treatment of urban stormwater, typically showing high nutrient uptake. However, the impact of high temporal variability of rainfall events (further exacerbated by climate change) on nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes, within different biofiltration designs, is still unknown. Hence, a laboratory-based study was conducted to uncover mechanisms behind nutrient removal in biofilters across different drying and wetting regimes. Two sets of experimental columns were based on (1) the standard biofiltration design (unsaturated zone only), and (2) combination of unsaturated and saturated (submerged) zone (SZ) with additional carbon source. Columns were watered with synthetic stormwater according to three drying and wetting schemes, exploring 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7-week drying. Hydraulic performance, soil moisture and pollutant removal were monitored. The results show that hydraulic conductivity of SZ design experiences less change over time compared to standard design, due to slower media drying, crack formation and lower plant die-off. Varied drying lengths challenged both designs differently, with 2-week drying resulting in significant drop of performance across most pollutants in standard design (except ammonia), while SZ design was able to retain high performance for up to four weeks of drying, sustaining microbial and plant uptake. Increased oxygenation of SZ columns during short-term drying was beneficial for ammonia and phosphorus removal. While SZ design showed better performance and quicker recovery for nitrogen removal, in regions with inter-rain event shorter than two weeks, the standard design (no saturated zone, no carbon source) can achieve similar if not better results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'The COVID-19 pandemic and its global response have resulted in unprecedented and rapid changes to most people’s day-to-day lives. To slow the spread of the virus, governments have implemented the practice of physical distancing (“social distancing”), which includes isolation within the home with limited time spent outdoors. During this extraordinary time, nature around the home may play a key role in mitigating against adverse mental health outcomes due to the pandemic and the measures taken to address it. To assess whether this is the case, we conducted an online questionnaire survey (n\\xa0=\\xa03,000) in Tokyo, Japan, to quantify the association between five mental health outcomes (depression, life satisfaction, subjective happiness, self-esteem, and loneliness) and two measures of nature experiences (frequency of greenspace use and green view through windows from home). Accounting for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, we found that the frequency of greenspace use and the existence of green window views from within the home was associated with increased levels of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness and decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Our findings suggest that a regular dose of nature can contribute to the improvement of a wide range of mental health outcomes. With the recent escalation in the prevalence of mental health disorders, and the possible negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health, our findings have major implications for policy, suggesting that urban nature has great potential to be used as a “nature-based solution” for improved public health. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America',\n",
       " 'Natural water retention measures (NWRMs) belong to the broad range of nature-based solutions and are receiving increased attention for targeting environmental problems of river catchments as they effectively support the restoration of natural processes and cycles. Challenges involved in NWRMs planning include the development of tools able to project and diagnose the effects at different spatial scales (e.g., catchment or the reach). This paper focuses on NWRMs addressing fine bed material deposits (FBMDs), with the aim of a) assessing factors and scales that control FBMDs; b) simulating the cascading impact of NWRMs on catchment hydrology, sediment loads, reach hydraulics, and FBMD; and c) assessing the effectiveness of NWRMs in targeting FBMDs at different spatial scales (catchment and reach). A modeling cascade was used to propagate the effects. This included a hydrological model (SWAT), a hydraulic model (HEC-RAS), and a spatially distributed Random Forest ensemble to model FBMDs risk for the Aist catchment (650 km2) Austria. Our results show that upstream sediment loads are an important predictor controlling the likelihood of sites to be classified as low risk. The effectiveness of NWRMs in reducing FBMDs is variable and depends on the target risk class. Vegetated filter strips that can trap sediments before they enter into the stream are more effective in increasing the extent of the river network towards natural conditions (5% increase compared to baseline). Sediment retention ponds are effective in reducing the extent of reaches where instream habitats are completely clogged by FBMDs (−8%). Hydromorphological improvements are effective in targeting sites where FBMDs are transported even during mean flow (−10%). A combination of NWRMs could benefit both high-risk as well as low-risk sites. The effectiveness of NWRMs can greatly differ when both reach and catchment diagnostics are analyzed. Thus, multi-scale assessment of the effectiveness can support NWRMs planning by unraveling all the potential benefits and highlighting tradeoffs hidden by analyses limited to a single spatial scale. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'The increasing exposure to air pollutants associated with the world-wide process of urbanization is among the most important risk factors for human health. In this context, the development of green infrastructures has gained interest for providing new win-win solutions for improving air quality and urban climate. In the present work, we have characterized an innovative, engineered green infrastructure, the CityTree (CT), in a real urban setting. Abatement rate of priority pollutants (PMx, NOx, black carbon) by a CT unit was determined, during three intensive field campaigns in the city of Modena (Italy). The measurements of the air filtered through the CT (active mode) showed significant reductions in particulate matter concentration: 19–23% for PM10 aerosol mass, 15–20% for PM2.5, 11–13% for PM1, 38% for ultrafine particle number concentration and 17% for black carbon concentration. The measurements in passive mode (with ventilation off) enabled the estimation of the deposition velocities of aerosol particles and gases onto the device surface. The average deposition velocities for PM10 and NOx observed for the CT mosses fall in the range reported in the scientific literature for other types of green surfaces (e.g., grass lawns, hedges). A comparison of the pollutant removal efficiency between passive and active CT mode was performed. The aerosol removal efficiency of the CT resulted from ~3 to almost 20 times higher in filtration than in deposition mode, according to the selected aerosol parameter. These results indicate that moss bio-filters can be more effective in removing air pollutants than standard green infrastructures for in situ applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Biocrust-mediated in situ bioremediation could be an alternative strategy to mitigate metal(loid) pollution in aquatic habitats. To better understand the roles of biocrusts in regulating the fate of metal(loid)s, we examined the morphology, composition and structure of biological aqua crusts (BAC) developed in the mine drainage of a representative Pb/Zn tailing pond, and tested their effectiveness for immobilizing typical metal(loid)s. Unlike terrestrial biocrusts, BAC results from an assembly of compounds produced by the strong microbial activity and mineral compounds present in the aquatic environment. The BAC exhibited a unique flexible, spongy and porous structure with a specific surface area of 12-22 m2 g−1, and was able to effectively concentrate various metal(loid)s (e.g. Cd, 0.26-0.60 g kg−1; Pb, 0.52-0.66 g kg−1; As, 10.4-24.3 g kg−1). The concentrations of metal(loid)s (e.g. Cd and As) in the BAC were even three to seven times higher than those in the source tailings, and more than 98% of immobilized metal(loid)s were present as the highly stable non-EDTA-exchangeable fraction. Adsorption on the well distributed micro-particles of the clay minerals (e.g. kaolinite) and the organic matters (2.0-2.7 wt.%) were found to be the major mechanisms for BAC to bind metal cations, whereas adsorption and coprecipitation on Fe/Mn oxide (e.g. FeOOH), was proposed to be the dominant pathway for accumulating metal(loid)s, especially As. The decrease in aqueous concentrations of the metal(loid)s along the drainage could be attributed in part to the scavenging effects of the BAC. These findings therefore provide new insights into the possible and efficient strategy for metal(loid) removal from water bodies, and highlighted the important role of BAC as a nature-based solution to benefit the bioremediation of mining area. © 2020',\n",
       " \"The contribution of Nature Based Solutions (NBSs) for supporting climate change adaptation and water-related risks reduction is becoming increasingly relevant for policy and decision-makers, compared to ‘grey infrastructures’, thanks to their capability to jointly deal with a multiplicity of societal and environmental challenges, producing several co-benefits besides limiting the impacts of water-related risks. Nevertheless, their mainstreaming is still limited by several barriers, which are often related to socio-institutional (e.g. limited cooperation and stakeholders' involvement, limited awareness about NBSs impacts) rather than to technical aspects. In this context, innovative tools for NBSs planning, design, implementation and assessment are required, along with effective processes capable of supporting stakeholders' participation. The present research aims to propose a shift in the approach to NBSs design, based on the early stakeholders' involvement in the identification, modelling and performance assessment in terms of benefits and, particularly, co-benefits production. A multi-step methodology was implemented for the purpose, combining both individual and participatory activities. Reference is made to one of the case studies of the NAIAD project, namely the Balta Potelu Pond Area (Lower Danube, Romania). Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) were used to describe the system in terms of causal connections and mutual influences, incorporating stakeholders' views and ideas. Inputs from both institutional (e.g. ministries and municipalities) and non-institutional stakeholders (e.g. NGOs and members of the local communities) were integrated. This allowed a comparative assessment of multiple NBSs, based on the analysis of benefits and co-benefits produced, as well as the identification of trade-offs among different stakeholders (e.g. the increase of agricultural production versus biodiversity conservation) and potential side effects. CLDs were then coupled with a Performance Matrix (a basic feature of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) and fuzzy logic to help decision-makers identify the most suitable NBSs for the area. The whole process was aimed at facilitating the process of NBSs selection and analysis, while considering the multiple impacts associated with their implementation. © 2020 The Author(s)\",\n",
       " 'Climate variability and change coupled with small landholdings, low land productivity and water scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions contribute to environmental degradation, reduced agricultural productivity, and increased vulnerability to the rural communities. With the aid of the fuzzy cognitive maps constructed by 427 community groups with 4–5 members in each group, drawn from 96 villages in 12 districts of arid and semi-arid India, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of various adaptation pathways. The ongoing adaptations in arid and semi-arid India face adaptation deficits. The FCM-based simulations revealed that integrated adaptation measures that embrace nature-based solutions, including integrated water resource management, natural farming-assisted soil rejuvenation, and improved agricultural productivity are most likely to enhance the resilience of small and marginalised farming communities to climate variability and change. Facilitation of such adaptation measures requires inclusive and adaptive local institutions, sufficient financial assistance, and climate information services. Besides, gender-nuanced, inclusive, and adaptive governance and processes would be helpful for the implementation of appropriate adaptation interventions in arid and semi-arid drylands worldwide. Hence policy-makers must enable polycentric and adaptive governance, and inclusive institutions and processes. The emphasis on multiple factors in a socio-ecological system often makes it difficult to understand the critical role of a particular factor. However, the FCM-based simulations in this study helped us overcome such limitations. © 2020',\n",
       " \"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are promising examples of Nature-Based Solutions that can protect diversity while delivering ecosystem services. However insufficient funding for effective management and expansion of MPAs remains a challenge and one that particularly affects developing countries. During the last ten years, a community of investors seeking positive social and environmental impacts alongside financial returns, have stepped in to help fill this marine conservation financing gap. An innovative collaborative management approach has been recently implemented in the Dominican Republic for one of the largest MPAs in the Caribbean. Blended finance solutions mixing catalytic, development and impact finance have been used to cover the up-front capital needs. MPA revenues are being generated for MPA management and investor returns, via a range of sustainable finance tools including fees paid by visitors. The solution offers interesting outcomes that uses catalytic and development finance to mobilise commercial impact finance into MPAs. From a Government point of view, the approach provides empirical evidence of how non-public funding can become part of the financing options for a country's MPA network, reducing the financial burden on Public Budgets. Scalability of the approach seems limited by the number of MPAs with tangible business models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'Rewilding has been proposed as an opportunity for biodiversity conservation in abandoned landscapes. However, rewilding is challenged by the increasing fire risk associated with more flammable landscapes, and the loss of open-habitat specialist species. Contrastingly, supporting High Nature Value farmlands (HNVf) has been also highlighted as a valuable option, but the effective implementation of agricultural policies often fails leading to uncertain scenarios wherein the effects of wildfire management remain largely unexplored. Herein, we simulated fire-landscape dynamics to evaluate how fire suppression scenarios affect fire regime and biodiversity (102 species of vertebrates) under rewilding and HNVf policies in the future (2050), in a transnational biosphere reserve (Gerês-Xurés Mountains, Portugal-Spain). Rewilding and HNVf scenarios were modulated by three different levels of fire suppression effectiveness. Then, we quantified scenario effects on fire regime (burned and suppressed areas) and biodiversity (habitat suitability change for 2050). Simulations confirm HNVf as a long-term opportunity for fire suppression (up to 30,000 ha of additional suppressed areas between 2031 and 2050 in comparison to rewilding scenario) and for conservation (benefiting around 60% of species). Rewilding benefits some species (20%), including critically endangered, vulnerable and endemic taxa, while several species (33%) also profit from open habitats created by fire. Although HNVf remains the best scenario, rewilding reinforced by low fire suppression management may provide a nature-based solution when societal support through agricultural policies fails. © 2020 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'The occurrence and removal of 49 antibiotics and 11 selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were investigated in 2 vertical subsurface flow (VF) constructed wetlands (1.5 m2 each): an unsaturated (UVF) unit and a partially saturated (SVF) unit (0.35 m saturated out of 0.8 m) operating in parallel and treating urban wastewater. Thirteen antibiotics were detected in influent wastewater, 6 of which were present in all samples. The SVF showed statistical significance on the removal of 4 compounds (namely ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pipemidic acid and azithromycin), suggesting that the wider range of pH and/or redox conditions of this configuration might promote the microbial degradation of some antibiotics. In contrast, the concentration of the latter (except pipemidic acid) and also clindamycin was higher in the effluent than in the influent of the UVF. Five ARGs were detected in influent wastewater, sul1 and sul2, blaTEM, ermB and qnrS. All of them were detected also in the biofilm of both wetlands, except qnrS. Average removal rates of ARGs showed no statistical differences between both wetland units, and ranged between 46 and 97% for sul1, 33 and 97% for sul2, 9 and 99% for ermB, 18 and 97% for qnrS and 11 and 98% for blaTEM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Based on an original survey, we find that individuals with strong personal norms and beliefs related to altruistic concerns and the ascription of responsibility show a high preference for NBS strategies.

       " 'Global climate change impacts the future of urbanism. The future is increasingly uncertain, and current responses in urban planning practice are often human-centered. In general, this is a way to respond to change that is oriented towards improving the life of people in the short term, often extracting resources from the environment at dangerous levels. This impacts the entire ecological system, and turns out to be negative for biodiversity, resilience, and, ultimately, human life as well. Adaptation to climatic impacts requires a long-term perspective based in the understanding of nature. The objective of the presented research is to find explorative ways to respond to the unknown unknowns through designing and planning holistically for the Zernike campus in Groningen, the Netherlands. The methods used in this study comprise co-creative design-led approaches which are capable of integrating sectoral problems into a visionary future plan. The research findings show how embracing a nature-driven perspective to urban design increases the adaptive capacity, the ecological diversity, and the range of healthy food grown on a university campus. This study responds to questions of food safety, and growing conditions, of which the water availability is the most pressing. Considering the spatial concept, this has led to the necessity to establish a novel water connection between the site and the sea. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Coastal rural communities worldwide face many challenges not only related to climate change but also extreme events, environmental degradation, population growth or aging, and conflict usage of the ecosystem. Historically, the economies of coastal communities have been based on the exploitation of natural resources, thus shaping its socioeconomic development. This has led to some limitations in the way these communities can now adapt to climate change. In Canada, coastal communities are increasingly dealing with climate change consequences. Sea level rise, coastal erosion, and increasing frequency in storm surges threaten the fragility of both natural and human systems. Various approaches have been used to try to reduce the vulnerability and improve adaptive capacity of communities. One approach, promoted by many organizations including the United Nations, is ecosystem-based adaptation. This approach is part of the series of nature-based solutions that help social–ecological systems become more resilient; by promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, this approach also relates to principles of community engagement and supports adaptive governance and social inclusion. This paper describes and analyzes these principles and considers strategies for ensuring community engagement. Combining ecosystem-based adaptation with a strong community engagement can enhance the long-term sustainability of the social-ecological system. © 2021 by the author.

       " 'The increasing risk of flooding requires obtaining generalized knowledge for the implementation of distinct and innovative intervention strategies, such as nature-based solutions. Inclusion of ecosystems in flood risk management has proven to be an adaptive strategy that achieves multiple benefits. However, obtaining generalizable quantitative information to increase the reliability of such interventions through experiments or numerical models can be expensive, laborious, or computationally demanding. This paper presents a probabilistic model that represents interconnected elements of vegetated hydrodynamic systems using a nonparametric Bayesian network (NPBN) for seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves. NPBNs allow for a system-level probabilistic description of vegetated hydrodynamic systems, generate physically realistic varied boundary conditions for physical or numerical modeling, provide missing information in data-scarce environments, and reduce the amount of numerical simulations required to obtain generalized results-all of which are critically useful to pave the way for successful implementation of nature-based solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'We studied the effects of three soil management approaches (permanent grassing, chemical weeding, and buffer strips), and the additional impact of tractor passage on soil erosion in a sloping vineyard located in the inner part of Aosta Valley (N-W Italian Alps). The vineyard rows were equipped with a sediment collection system with channels and barrel tanks. A total of 12 events with sediment production were observed across 6 years, and the collected sediments were weighted and analyzed. Average erosion rates ranged from negligible (mainly in grassed rows) to 1.1 t ha−1 per event (after weeding). The most erosive event occurred in July 2015, with a total rainfall of 32.2 mm, of which 20.1 were recorded in 1 h. Despite the limited number of erosive events observed, and the low measured erosion rates, permanent grassing reduced soil erosion considerably with respect to weeding; buffering had a comparable effect to grassing. The tractor passage, independent of the soil management approaches adopted, visibly accelerated the erosion process. The collected sediments were highly enriched in organic C, total N, and fine size fractions, indicating a potential loss of fertility over time. Despite the measured erosion rates being low over the experiment’s duration, more severe events are well documented in the recent past, and the number of intense storms is likely to increase due to climate change. Thus, the potential effects of erosion in the medium and long term need to be limited to a minimum rate of soil loss. Our experiment helped to compare soil losses by erosion under different soil management practices, including permanent grassing, i.e., a nature-based erosion mitigation measure. The results of the research can provide useful indications for planners and practitioners in similar regions, for sustainable, cross-sectoral soil management, and the enhancement of soil ecosystem services. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The evolution of long-term sustainable societies is closely connected to the transformation of the physical built environment in which those societies operate. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of narratives for the built environment in Japan, consistent with the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) framework, to assess the future evolution of the adaptation and mitigation challenges. We focus on the linkage between sustainability factors and human living environments including urban form, buildings, and basic infrastructures. We introduce a new, sixth narrative to the SSPs, an alternative interpretation of SSP1. Whereas the original SSP1 assumes high societal and environmental sustainability combined with relatively high economic growth, the SSP1 variant does not highly rely on economic growth and is oriented towards a lower and more locally oriented consumption lifestyle. Nature-based solutions are integrated and examined in the new SSP1 narrative, which is aligned with the adaptation to the digital era with freedom of location. Recent global crises such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic may accelerate the transformation of societies. Therefore, this study attempts to imply the benefits and trade-offs of alternative pathways for the built environment. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",

In a context of climate change and growing concern about the loss of biodiversity, indicators informing about ecosystem complexity, resilience and stability are required. NBS projects hardly ever include environmental monitoring programs and, at best, NBS performance is evaluated based on elementary indicators that provide poor information about ecosystem functions and services. Within the framework of the PHUSICOS (EU, H2020) project, a NBS approach is being applied to reduce the hydrometeorological risks (rock falls and snow ava-lanches) that threaten a transnational road and a very populated town in the Pyrenees range. In both cases, the planned actions are modifying soil and vegetation structure and functioning as well as the environmental services they provide. Here we present a set of soil and plant indicators designed to be included in the postoperation monitoring plan of both NBS projects.

However, NBS realization depends critically on the governance framework that enables the NBS policy process. Drawing from three case studies in Nocera Inferiore (Italy), Munich (Germany), and Wolong (China), we identify key governance ena-blers—the contextual preconditions, policy processes, and institutions—that proved essential for NBS initiation, planning, design, and implementation. In the three cases, interviews confirm the success of the NBS measures and their benefits in terms not only of DRR but of multiple ecological and social–economic co-benefits. Results highlight critical governance enablers of NBS, including: polycentric governance (novel arrangements in the public administration that involved multiple institutional scales and/or sectors); co-design (innovative stakeholder participatory processes that influenced the final NBS); pro-NBS interest and coalition groups (organized pressure groups that advocated for an NBS); and financial incentives (financing community-based implementation and monitoring of NBS). Findings show that the transition to NBS can contribute to multiple global agendas, including DRR, climate change adaptation, and sustainable development. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

Awareness about additional ESs of CWs can be raised with value transfer (VT) methods for ESs monetization, in particular, the simplified adjusted unit VT method. A multi‐criteria analysis (MCA) was performed to compare grey and green infrastructure alternatives for the management of a combined sewer overflow in the Buccinasco town (Italy), in which the criteria related to ESs were monetized with an adjusted VT method (B£ST software). The results highlighted the potential interest in the implementation of the green infrastructure in a new urban park, due to the activation of additional ESs of interest, such as health and recreational aspects. The results were also confirmed by a sensitivity analysis, which simulated the variation of preferences among different stakeholder groups (e.g., citizens, environmentalists).

The aim of this study is to tailor the SDGs, as a universally recognized policy framework, to assess the sustainability performance for coastal flood protection management to enhance climate-resilient and adaptable coastal development. To operationalize this aim, the SDG Sustainability Impact Score (SDG-SIS) framework was developed. Based on system functionalities for the land– sea interface, 38 SDGs were identified in the SDG-SIS framework. Given the availability of public numeric data, only 12 SDG targets are connected with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The SDG-SIS framework was applied to two different sets of cases, including five coastline and five sand nourishment cases. This study shows that the geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the two sets of cases should be considered in the selection of system functionalities as well as the consideration of SDG targets. Moreover, cross-linking cumulative consequences of SIS do not directly indicate the level of sustainability, but the individual SDG target data are essential to reveal the underlying details. This stresses the importance of prioritizing SDGs to serve as leverage for policymakers to optimize the climate resilience and adaptation of coastal management. The SDG-SIS framework enables the support of coastal policy by addressing long-term measures and providing a sustainable vision for future implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a pilot experiment was conducted to assess the efficiency of SOWU for effluent quality polishing in a municipal wastewater treatment plant targeting 33 residual emerging contaminants (ECs) that were categorized into six groups, namely pharmaceuticals, sunscreens, bactericides, pesticides, flame retardants and phenols. In the 14-day monitoring period, each of the ECs decayed following a first order reaction, and about 61 % total ECs removal was achieved, indicating the remarkable photolysis effect of the SOWU under natural conditions. The significant removal of ECs, especially the very high removals of pharmaceuticals (76 %) and sunscreens (77 %), was associated with the attenuation of both the acute luminescent bacterial toxicity and genotoxicity. From the linear relationship between the acute toxicity and chromophoric dissolved organic matter and that between genotoxicity and UV absorbance at 254 nm, it was likely that the attenuation of biotoxicities resulted from the decay of chromophoric and aromatic compounds. By analyzing several reactive species, the excellent photoreactivity of the SOWU was further identified. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

However, as the use of NBS is increasing, a number of barriers regarding their practical implementation also become apparent. A number of review studies have summarized and classified barriers, mainly in urban settings. PHUSICOS is a Horizon 2020 Innovation Action to demonstrate the use of NBS in rural and mountain landscapes. Large-scale demonstrator case sites with several sub-projects are established in Italy, Norway and in the French and Spanish Pyrenees. The present paper describes the project’s NBS measures and their experienced barriers, some of which have resulted in full cancellation of the planned interventions. Many of the barriers experienced in rural settings have the same root causes as the ones described from urban areas, and the main barrier-creating mechanisms are institutional factors, resistance among stakeholders and technical and economic issues. The key element, however, is the lack of knowledge about the ability of NBS to deliver a series of co-benefits in addition to their risk-reducing effects and that long-term thinking is required to see the effect of many of these co-benefits. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, significant barriers exist for the necessary large-scale implementation of NBS and market development is still in its infancy. This study presents findings from a systematic review of literature and a survey on private sector agents in the planning and implementation of NBS, with the aim to identify them. In this study, we propose a typology for organisations delivering NBS and a categorisation of their economic activities. The most common organisation type found is nature-based enterprise which offers products or services where nature is a core element and used sustainably and engages in economic activity. Moreover, eleven categories of economic activities were identified, ranging from ecosystem restoration, living green roofs, and eco-tourism to smart technologies and community engagement for NBS. Nature-based enterprises contribute to a diverse range of sustainable economic activities, that standard industry classification systems do not adequately account for.

Fourteen priority EbA practices were established and categorized into four major groups based on their application similarities. Among the anticipated ecosystem services were enhanced water resource conservation, food and feed production, enhanced energy supply, and improved community livelihoods to enhance their resilience. Pathways on how each practice under the broad category contributes to water, energy, and food were developed to demonstrate how they individually and collectively contribute towards the nexus balance.

The total value of the disaster was 1.7 billion Euros. Traditional flood protection measures proved to be insufficient in that extreme flood event, which raised the question of a greater change towards active flood protection measures. Their implementation can require new legal solutions and changes in existing legislation. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze whether existing legal regulations in Serbia in this field provide an adequate basis for the implementation of new flood risk management measures, or some changes are needed. As nature-based solutions require larger areas of land, the question of how that land could be obtained arose. In that regard, pre-emption right and expropriation as possible instruments for acquiring the land were analyzed. It was concluded that they are not suitable and that other solutions should be found. The results of the research showed that there is a necessity for new legislation, especially regarding water storage on private land, as legal lacunae was detected in this field.

       " \"Land resources can accommodate extra floodwaters, thus playing an important role in integrated flood risk management (FRM). However, potential conflicts emerge as the lands that are used as temporal room for floodwaters are also home to human beings, which is common in the flood detention zones (FDZs) in China. To date, little is known about how Chinese policies address the conflicts and how local stakeholders perceive the policies. This paper aims to address this research gap using a case study of the FDZs in the middle Huaihe River, China. A mixed method is applied including an official document survey, a multi-layer interview (15 respondents), and questionnaires (123 respondents). We find that three major strategies are employed to enhance the flood detention function and reduce flood risk inside the FDZs: 1) returning parts of the FDZs to rivers; 2) flood-adaptive farming; and 3) reducing population density via a massive relocation. However, the local residents have a low engagement willingness, which are associated with a poor perception of the policies and a lack of short-term economic attractiveness. Policy delivery gaps thus exist. Information sharing should be enhanced to encourage public participation. A public-private partnership involving more social and financial resources, particularly including the downstream beneficiaries, could help to increase the policy's economic feasibility. The findings can enrich a policy shift toward a more land-based FRM, particularly in developing countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",

In this context, planning and developing NBS may prove to be a powerful instrument to raise the interest of young people towards formerly degraded urban and peri-urban areas and ecosystems. The results of a survey focused on a specific NBS site and involving 1543 university students demonstrate that gender is the factor that most influences the perception of NBS. Females tend to have a good knowledge and a positive perception of NBS, and they are keen to visit sites where NBS are present; in contrast, males emerge as a very heterogeneous group, with different levels of knowledge and perception of NBS among them, as well as different attitudes towards visiting NBS sites.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) could address these challenges sustainably and with multiple benefits, but their uptake in policy and planning is limited, and stakeholder perspectives are conspicuously lacking from current research. Here, we report the results of a collaborative, multi-stakeholder exercise to identify priority knowledge needs (KNs) that could enhance the uptake of NbS in Mediterranean islands. We used a well-established iterative prioritisation method based on a modified Delphi process. This was conducted by the authors, environmental policy and practice stakeholders from across the Mediterranean islands, representing business, government, NGOs and research. We developed a long list of potential KNs through individual submissions, and prioritised them through voting, discussion and scoring. Excepting workshop discussion, all individual contributions were anonymous. We present the 47 resulting KNs in rank order, classified by whether they can be addressed by knowledge synthesis and further research, or demand action in policy and practice. The top priority KNs are i) a more precise definition of NbS, ii) which NbS are adapted to dry Mediterranean conditions? iii) how to increase the adoption and use of NbS in urban plans?, iv) how can buildings and built-up areas be modified to accommodate green infrastructure and v) cost-benefit analysis of urban green spaces. In collaboration with these stakeholders, our findings will determine future research strategies on NbS implementation in the Mediterranean islands. © 2020',\n",
       " 'Multi-storey estates that concentrate a high share of the urban population are of particular importance for the quality of life in European Cities. To explore the diversity of their socio-environmental potential, we investigated complexes of different spatial structures, environmental, social and economic conditions - socmodernist estates from 1960 to 1990 and modern multifamily residential areas built since the 1990s. We examined 225 multifamily housing estates in Berlin, Germany and 92 in Poznań, Poland. The GIS analysis have been supplemented with field mapping and assessment. Our pilot study shows that environmental conditions in socmodernist housing areas are more favorable than in new development sites. Socmodernist estates are rich in green spaces (42.3–49.6%) that are often invisible in the official statistics but play an important role in local communities and urban environment. Therefore we took a closer look at their current state through the prism of nature-based solution (NBS). NBS are treated as activities that increase the ecosystem services capacity through the creation of green infrastructure (GI) elements, strengthening its quality and/or multifunctionality and supporting its diverse usage. To assess the quantity, arrangement, and purpose of GI design at socmodernist estates we have studied 4 multifamily residential areas. We found a large variety of green space types and exceptional NBS that at a local scale improve nature-based outdoor activities. The results show the existing large GI potential, which is by far neither fully discovered nor used. Unlocking this potential can drive positive changes in social-ecological conditions of housing areas that are underrated today. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Urban streams and ecosystems are highly affected by the intense development of cities and an increase of impervious surfaces. If these environments are close to their pristine state, they can be considered a nature-based solution promoting the integration of both green and blue elements in the cities, while providing a wide range of services (e.g. better aesthetics, air quality, leisure areas, and mitigation of climatic changes). In view of this, the current study aimed to develop a holistic assessment tool for urban streams that can be used to highlight their importance and support decision makers in the elaboration of measures to recover urban streams. The tool called Urban stream Assessment system (UsAs) includes the assessment of (1) biodiversity, (2) ecological functions and habitat that are inherent components of the ecosystems, and (3) provisioning, regulating, and cultural services, following The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES). The tool includes 89 indicators belonging to 17 divisions (services and functions) selected from studies on urban areas and fluvial ecosystems. In addition, the tool introduces a method for the measurement of an indicator, rationale for the used indicator, positive and negative scope of the indicator, and reference to the proposed method. The tool incorporates also a step-by-step scoring system, which results in a global quality classification of streams. The UsAs tool was tested with a case study stream located in the city of Coimbra, Central Portugal. The final classification attributed to this stream was moderate, which is slightly higher than the ecological status, highlighting its potential ecosystem services (ES). However, the UsAs clearly showed a poor biodiversity (namely of aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, fish, aquatic mammals, and terrestrial insects), habitat conditions and the most compromised services that could be improved: water supply, air quality, health and well-being. The use of this novel tool supports also new research and knowledge on aquatic ecosystems and particularly urban streams by generating relevant data to answer and test important ecological questions, such as the influence of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning and services. Further investigation should focus more on tests in different types of urban streams, regions, and climates. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'This paper aims to explore how resilience to climate change can be achieved and optimised within an example of a complex, high-vulnerability and low-elevation coastal zone. In Uist, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, a completed INTERREG project provided a framework for resilience planning in a complex, multifaceted environment, where official bodies, NGOs, academics and the community already work together productively. A range of approaches to coping with climate change in Uist is reviewed, some of these originating from within the community, and the local situation is discussed in the context of the extent to which resilience theory and national policy intertwine. These approaches identify and combine nature-based solutions and compatible engineering-based solutions, demonstrating how resilience can be achieved and enhanced in a vulnerable area via sustained engagement with local communities backed by peer-reviewed research and complying with the policy context. © 2020',\n",
       " 'Local people must be at the center of restoring landscapes. This paper adapts the popular Restoration Opportunity Assessment Methodology (ROAM), which helps show where land can be restored in a given area by growing trees or protecting forests, to the economically poor yet resource-rich Sidhi District of Madhya Pradesh in India. By employing an intersectional adaptive governance lens and including the perspectives of people and organizations throughout the larger social landscape, we analyzed the multiple benefits landscape restoration can have on ecosystem services, social inclusion, the economy, and local livelihoods. These participatory methods and tools draw attention to the critical socio-economic components of restoration. The findings indicate that different social groups, like powerful men and marginalized women, have different restoration goals (even for tree species selection). They also show that investing in restoration can create thousands of jobs and secure thousands of rural livelihoods. Analyses that produce these socioeconomic insights can inform implementation strategies that are both inclusive and actionable on the ground. They can also identify roadblocks, like unclear land tenure and resource rights, which can impede restoration. Most importantly, these inclusive strategies can ensure that local people serve as more than passive beneficiaries. They place them in their appropriate role as the central stakeholders driving implementation. © 2021 University of Wisconsin Press. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions are quickly rising to the top of the sustainable urban development agenda as an ecosystem-based approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change, while also improving livelihoods and biodiversity. Achieving sustainability and resilience through nature-based solutions is an important means for cities and communities across the globe to take climate action and experiment with new forms governance, infrastructure, and planning and design. In this paper, I map the academic research structure of nature-based solutions and find that issues of social and environmental justice remain peripheral. To center justice in research and practice, I argue for a re-orientation towards just nature-based solutions—approaches that utilize the power of nature and people to transform the social, political, and economic drivers of socio-spatial inequality and environmental degradation into opportunities to create progressive, cohesive, antiracist, and social-ecologically sustainable communities. Based on the findings of the literature review and bibliometric analysis, I propose three pathways for just nature-based solutions: (1) race and class; (2) transformative co-production; and (3) value articulations. These starting points link to current principles in nature-based solutions and help bring clarity for scholars, activists, and planners on how to critically engage with the politics of environmental governance and decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Hazards in coastal ecosystems, such as flooding and land loss, demand natural and nature-based solutions from local communities due to the protective and non-protective services they provide when compared with traditionally engineered approaches. In this context, natural solutions are those that consider conserving existing habitats whereas nature-based solutions are those created by humans. These solutions support important coastal ecosystem functions, such as nutrient uptake, fisheries habitat, soil carbon storage, and surge attenuation. Our main research questions were: (1) Based on community engagement, what are the possible natural and nature-based solutions to address coastal hazards in Breton Sound Estuary, Louisiana? and (2) How do these community co-designed nature-based solutions support various ecosystem functions? To help answer these questions, we leveraged the competency group methodology to incorporate the local needs and traditional ecological knowledge of community stakeholders into collaborative ecosystem modelling. In total, fifteen members regularly met five times over an eight-month period to design nature-based solutions to address coastal hazards. Two nature-based solutions, created marshes and restored ridges, were identified most frequently by the competency group (>75% occurrence) in a final survey. Associated ecosystem functions of the identified solutions were assessed with simulation models to determine future ecosystem functions of nutrient uptake, fisheries habitat, soil carbon storage, and surge attenuation after 20 years. By adding created marshes to an ecosystem, our model results indicate slight increases in nutrient uptake, likely increases to fisheries habitat and soil carbon storage capacity, as well as storm surge attenuation in some areas following ridge restoration. Quantifying these ecosystem functions with management actions has been limited and is needed to assess how natural and nature-based solutions impact local communities and resource users. This novel approach to modeling ecosystem-based solutions through a collaborative modeling process with researchers and residents can be applied elsewhere to assess the viability of natural and nature-based solutions. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'This article provides a perspective on nature-based solutions. First, the argument is developed that nature-based solutions integrate social and ecological systems. Then, theoretical considerations relating to relational values, multifunctionality, transdisciplinarity, and polycentric governance are briefly outlined. Finally, a conceptual model of the social–ecological system of nature-based solutions is synthesised and presented. This conceptual model comprehensively defines the social and ecological external and internal systems that make up nature-based solutions, and identifies theoretical considerations that need to be addressed at different stages of their planning and implementation The model bridges the normative gaps of existing nature-based solution frameworks and could be used for consistent, comprehensive, and transferable comparisons internationally. The theoretical considerations addressed in this article inform practitioners, policymakers, and researchers about the essential components of nature-based solutions.

       " \"Extreme rainfall and flood events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. In UK upland areas, historical over-grazing and associated soil compaction have further exacerbated peak flood levels and flash-flood risk along many river catchments. As a result, the reinstatement of upland woodland is increasingly seen as a key component of an integrated suite of options forming part of natural flood management (NFM) associated with a 'public money for public goods' approach to European agriculture. Nevertheless, understanding the impact of native woodland establishment on upland soil hydrology remains relatively poor. We compare physical and hydrological properties from the surface soils of establishing woodland and grazed pasture across four flood vulnerable upland headwater catchments in Dartmoor National Park, SW England. We show upland native woodland establishment is a viable soil recovery option, with a doubling of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, increased 'wetness threshold' and reduced surface soil compaction and bulk density within 15 years of establishment. Our study supports the establishment of native woodland as an effective tool to improve the hydrological functioning of soils in upland pastoral catchments and the provision of flash-flood mitigation 'ecosystem services'. We caution, however, that land managers and policymakers must consider past and present management, soil type and catchment location when planning new NFM schemes if environmental benefits are to be maximised and 'public money for public goods, are to be commensurate with outcomes. © 2020 The Authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NbS) include all the landscape’s ecological components that have a function in the natural or urban ecosystem. Memorial Parking Trees (MPTs) are a new variant of a nature-based solution composed of a bioswale and a street tree allocated in the road, occupying a space that is sub-utilised by parked cars. This infill green practice can maximise the use of street trees in secondary streets and have multiple benefits in our communities. Using GIS mapping and methodology can support implementation in vulnerable neighbourhoods. In this research, we based vulnerability assessments for London, Rio de Janeiro, and Los Angeles on the following three indi-cators: extreme temperature, air quality, and flood-prone areas. Evidence is emerging that disad-vantaged populations may live at higher risks of exposure to environmental hazards [1]. The income and healthcare accessibility of neighbourhoods are the two indicators that will help us target these communities for a better and faster decision-making process. The contrast between the results and the 15-min city concept supports our detecting and prioritising neighbourhoods for MPTS imple-mentation, among other NbS solutions integrated into a more inclusive and sustainable urban de-sign. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Emergent aquatic vegetation (EAV) is an important part of wetland ecosystems that provide multiple ecological services. However, human activities and natural changes often influence wetland hydrological regimes such as water levels, salinity, and other factors, which greatly influence the survival and growth of wetland plants. Based on field measurements and control experiments, we developed an EAV model to simulate biomass dynamics under changing conditions of water levels and salinity. This model successfully reproduced the seasonal biomass variation of three typical emergent plants, Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia and Scirpus mariqueter, and simulated the response of EVA biomass under multiple scenarios of water levels and salinity in the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve (CDNR), Shanghai, China. Results suggest that there is a negative correlation between salinity and biomass. An optimal range of water levels are suitable for EAV, and biomass will decrease when the water levels are below or above their optimal range. Applying this dynamic EAV model is a cost-effective approach to find a sustainable and nature-based solution to managing and predicting wetland vegetation changes. The model and approach used in this study may provide a sustainable and nature-based solution for management and protection of wetland ecosystems, and may be transferrable to other wetland systems as well. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'The amelioration of air quality represents one of the most complex challenges that the European Union is facing today. Although a successful strategy to improve air quality should decisively act on pollution sources, Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) may provide a huge contribution to tackle air pollution, while delivering a wide range of Ecosystem Services and enhancing the Natural Capital. In this paper, we analyzed, in both biophysical and monetary terms, the role of the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) in improving air quality in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Southern Italy) by implementing an accounting model of PM10 removal. Our findings indicate that about 1,148 Mg of PM10 were annually removed by the UGI, for a monetary value of 36 million euros per year. We also assessed the impact of a devastating wildfire that occurred in 2017 in the study area, which resulted in a loss of PM10 removal of about 97 Mg and led to an estimated monetary loss of 3 million euros per year. The results also showed that PM10 removal efficiency largely varies seasonally and across different functional groups of vegetation, highlighting the role of functional biodiversity in the provision of Ecosystem Services under Mediterranean climate conditions. In conclusion, we maintain that the biophysical and economic assessment of Ecosystem Services can support local managers and policymakers in charge of developing urban planning strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable development and human well-being in metropolitan cities. © 2020',\n",

       " 'The term nature-based solutions (NBSs) is understood as a multidisciplinary umbrella concept that includes aspects such as green/blue infrastructure and urban gardens and forests. However, the important question here is what features of ecosystem-based approaches are essential for them to be considered nature-based? This study aims to answer this question by analysing the potential of allotment gardens (AGs) to be considered as NBSs. To do so, the possibilities and obstacles regarding a Polish case study were analysed based on the following six research questions: (1) How do AGs use blue and green infrastructure? (2) What problem(s) do AGs solve today? (3) What kind of benefits do AGs provide? (4) Do AGs possess implementation and management capabilities? (5) Can AGs be treated as economically efficient? (6) What are the advantages of AGs versus other possible solution(s)? With regards to obstacles, the study has identified: institutional barriers, irregular distribution of benefits, and deficiencies in economic efficiency. Nevertheless, AGs together with other historical urban green/blue infrastructure may be regarded as a kind of unsophisticated NBS, the effectiveness of which is limited. These solutions may be created as independent structures or (historical) green/blue infrastructure may be enlarged, fitted out, linked, and improved to implement NBS projects. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Stream and terrestrial ecosystems are intimately connected by riparian zones that support high biodiversity but are also vulnerable to human impacts. Landscape disturbances, overgrazing, and diffuse pollution of agrochemicals threaten riparian biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. We assessed how terrestrial invertebrate communities respond to changes in riparian vegetation in Romanian agricultural catchments, with a focus on the role of forested riparian buffers. Riparian invertebrates were sampled in 10 paired sites, with each pair consisting of an unbuffered upstream reach and a downstream reach buffered with woody riparian vegetation. Our results revealed distinct invertebrate community structures in the two site types. Out of 33 invertebrate families, 13 were unique to either forested (6) or unbuffered (7) sites. Thomisidae, Clubionidae, Tetragnathidae, Curculionidae, Culicidae, and Cicadidae were associated with forested buffers, while Lycosidae, Chrysomelidae, Staphylinidae, Coccinellidae, Tettigoniidae, Formicidae, and Eutichuridae were more abundant in unbuffered sites. Despite statistically equivocal results, invertebrate diversity was generally higher in forested riparian buffers. Local riparian attributes significantly influenced patterns in invertebrate community composition. Our findings highlight the importance of local woody riparian buffers in maintaining terrestrial invertebrate diversity and their potential contribution as a multifunctional management tool in agricultural landscapes. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly being promoted as a means to address societal and environmental challenges, especially flood risk reduction. In the context of rapidly urbanizing catchments, NBS can take part of the development of sustainable cities, either by conserving peri-urban ecosystems from urban sprawl or by developing green infrastructure in the cities. Both can provide a wide range of co-benefits (e.g., climate regulation, air quality regulation), but also generate some negative effects (e.g., mobility issues, unsafety, allergens). We develop and imple-ment a Discrete Choice Experiment survey to analyse people’s perception of co-benefits and negative effects, and associated preferences for the two types of NBS at a catchment scale. The results obtained from 400 households living in a French Mediterranean catchment highlight that people associate numerous co-benefits to NBS, but also negative effects. Our estimations reveal that resident households are ready to contribute large amounts through a tax increase for the development of NBS (from 140 to 180 EUR/year, on average). There is however a strong heterogeneity of preferences at the catchment scale influenced by income, location of the respondent along an urban–rural gradient, and perception of the importance of ecosystem services. These differences may reflect urban environmental inequalities at the catchment scale, which are important to take into account in order to avoid distributive inequalities. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'Urbanization leads to changes in the surface cover that alter the hydrological cycle of cities, particularly by increasing the impervious area and, thereby, reducing the interception, storage and infiltration capacity of rainwater. Nature-based solutions (NBS) can contribute to flood risk mitigation in urbanized areas by restoring hydrological functions. However, the effects of NBS on flood risk mitigation are complex and can differ substantially with the type of the NBS. Therefore, the effectiveness of NBS at the urban catchment scale is still subject to much debate, especially at the scale of urban catchments. In this study, the effects of different NBS on urban flood mitigation were evaluated for the city of Eindhoven in The Netherlands, as it has a history of urban flood events. To this end, various NBS scenarios were defined by municipal stakeholders and their impacts modelled with the numerical model Infoworks ICM. This was done for design storms with short, medium and long return periods (5, 10 and 100 years). Overall, the simulated NBS were effective in flood risk mitigation, reducing the flooded area as well as flood depth. The effectiveness of the individual NBS scenarios, however, depended strongly on the location and extension of the NBS, as well as on storm intensity. The effectiveness tended to increase with the increase in NBS surface area, while it tended to decrease with increasing storm intensity and, hence, return period. The NBS solution increasing street water storage was revealed to be more effective than those involving green car parks and green roofs. This study showed that numerical flooding models can be useful tools to assess the effects of NBS to reduce flood extent, water depth and/or velocity, providing insights that can support city planners to design and compare alternative strategies and plans for urban flood risk mitigation. © 2021 by the authors.

Within the ODySéYeu scientific project, which aims to analyze the sedimentary dynamics around the isle of Yeu (France), a consortium of different local actors was invited to collectively develop an integrated solution to monitor the coastal evolution of the isle in 3D. This new solution is composed of a combination of an application (SENTINELLES de la côte) and a specific workflow (SELPhCoAST), which guides citizens to acquire reliable in‐situ photo datasets with their own smart device, facilitates data transmission, and allows both a reliable data treatment and a public presentation of matters and results. This study presents the results of reproducibility and accuracy tests performed on a test‐site to validate the SELPhCoAST workflow, over 20 months of monitoring, with multiple operators and devices. Tests show that at least 95% of each SfM‐S model is identical to the terrestrial laser scans models within a range of ±5 cm, almost independently of the operator or smartphone model.

       " 'Natural hazards resulting from climate change are increasing in frequency and intensity. As this is not a linear trend but rather by singularities and anomalies including a broad spectrum of climatic and weather extremes with high tem\\xadporal and spatial uncertainty, focused avoidance strategies are difficult to prepare. However, the effects of climate change are mostly addressed with outdated ‘business as usual’ approaches by governments and most stakeholders, which are unfit to tackle the complexity of current challenges. Coping action for natural hazards is mostly undertaken during and after such events compensating damage through payments and restoration. In the future, pro-active nature-based solutions are needed for risk mitigation and avoiding severe damage through enhancing all facets of biodiversity from species richness, structural roughness, to spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems. This will not avoid extreme weather events, but it will reduce the damage of increasingly appearing natural hazards. However, this strategy cannot be implemented all of a sudden. Long-term and spatial concepts are needed. For this purpose, currently missing governance structures based on geographical, geoscientific, ecological, meteorological, and societal expertise should be installed. In recent years, a good scientific and knowledge basis for the required solutions has been developed, which now must translate into action. Here, a series of suggestions is compiled for a broad spectrum of extreme events and societal fields, which is far from being complete but should stimulate critically needed creativity and commitment. Nature-based solutions will not deliver a complete protection and cannot be the only kind of action, but we can no longer rely on post-disaster compensation or on the safety illusion of mere engineering and construction works. The efficiency of biodiversity as an insurance for maintaining ecosystem services is well understood. The implementation of nature-based adaptation, coping, and protection measures is less expensive than traditional end-of-the-pipe constructions. It requires an in-depth understanding of interacting processes and trans-disciplinary cooperation based on a broad acceptance in the public.

       " 'Simple and suitable treatment of swine slurry from small farms is paramount especially in sensitive areas. This paper evaluates the viability of an innovative nature-based technology hybrid system (a Vertical Flow Constructed Wetland followed by a Horizontal Flow Constructed Wetland both planted with reeds – Phragmites australis) to treat swine slurry for further land application or discharge in water bodies with reduced nitrogen impact. Physicochemical parameters, bacterial indicators, surface deposits and biomass inside the filters were monitored. The hybrid configuration offered a dual function for simultaneous solid-liquid separation and biological treatment. Removal of organic matter and suspended solids was very high (&gt;80% for SS and &gt;75% for COD and BOD5) while the overall nitrogen load removal was 65%, due to the combined nitrification/denitrification processes, thus effectively reducing swine slurry nitrogen content. The influence of temperature and design and operational parameters on the treatment efficiency and the hydraulic behavior were also studied. The vertical constructed wetland achieved good hydraulic performance with no clogging problems, despite high pollutant loads. Some of the pollutants were retained and mineralized in the surface deposit layer, increasing around 20\\xa0cm each year. This organic biosolid layer improved filtration efficiency. The high ammonia contents interfered with the growth of Phragmites australis, while the high concentration of suspended solids and organic matter determine the operation and design to be implemented. © Copyright © 2021 Torrens, Folch and Salgot.',\n",

       " 'For millennia, coastal and marine ecosystems have adapted and flourished in the Red Sea’s unique environment. Surrounded by deserts on all sides, the Red Sea is subjected to high dust inputs and receives very little freshwater input, and so harbors a high salinity. Coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangroves flourish in this environment and provide socio-economic and environmental benefits to the bordering coastlines and countries. Interestingly, while coral reef ecosystems are currently experiencing rapid decline on a global scale, those in the Red Sea appear to be in relatively better shape. That said, they are certainly not immune to the stressors that cause degradation, such as increasing ocean temperature, acidification and pollution. In many regions, ecosystems are already severely deteriorating and are further threatened by increasing population pressure and large coastal development projects. Degradation of these marine habitats will lead to environmental costs, as well as significant economic losses. Therefore, it will result in a missed opportunity for the bordering countries to develop a sustainable blue economy and integrate innovative nature-based solutions. Recognizing that securing the Red Sea ecosystems’ future must occur in synergy with continued social and economic growth, we developed an action plan for the conservation, restoration, and growth of marine environments of the Red Sea. We then investigated the level of resources for financial and economic investment that may incentivize these activities. This study presents a set of commercially viable financial investment strategies, ecological innovations, and sustainable development opportunities, which can, if implemented strategically, help ensure long-term economic benefits while promoting environmental conservation. We make a case for investing in blue natural capital and propose a strategic development model that relies on maintaining the health of natural ecosystems to safeguard the Red Sea’s sustainable development. © Copyright © 2021 Cziesielski, Duarte, Aalismail, Al-Hafedh, Anton, Baalkhuyur, Baker, Balke, Baums, Berumen, Chalastani, Cornwell, Daffonchio, Diele, Farooq, Gattuso, He, Lovelock, Mcleod, Macreadie, Marba, Martin, Muniz-Barreto, Kadinijappali, Prihartato, Rabaoui, Saderne, Schmidt-Roach, Suggett, Sweet, Statton, Teicher, Trevathan-Tackett, Joydas, Yahya and Aranda.',\n",
       " 'Degradation characterized by depleted vegetation cover is a serious environmental problem in African rangelands. It poses a serious threat to millions of pastoralists and agropastoralists who depend on livestock as a source of livelihood. Consequently, there has been a growing global interest to consolidate efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. For example, the UN decade of Ecosystem Restoration initiative aims at uniting the world behind a common goal of preventing, halting and reversing the degradation of ecosystems. Grass reseeding using native perennial species has been identified as one of the practical ecological strategies for restoring degraded African rangelands, enhancing vegetation cover and forage production. Knowledge of the multifaceted performance of African rangeland grasses in terms of morphoecological traits, interaction with weeds and water use efficiencies is however largely limited and often elusive. Perennial grasses indigenous to African rangelands Cenchrus ciliaris L. (African foxtail grass), Enteropogon macrostachyus (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) Monro ex Benth. (Bush rye grass) and Eragrostis superba Peyr. (Maasai love grass), were established in an African semi-arid rangeland under natural conditions to fill this knowledge gap. Morphoecological plant traits: aboveground biomass (shoot, leaf and stem) production, plant densities, basal cover, tiller densities and plant height were measured 9 months after establishment. Interaction between the target grass species and weeds and water use efficiencies (WUE) were also determined. Enteropogon macrostachyus displayed significantly higher values for plant densities, tiller densities and basal cover, indices commonly used to estimate the potential of grasses for ecological restoration. Eragrostis superba produced the highest shoot biomass and water use efficiencies. This is attributed to its higher leafy biomass fraction. Higher aboveground biomass production of E. superba demonstrate its suitability for enhancing rangeland productivity. Cenchrus ciliaris suppressed the weeds. This is linked to its aggressive and allelopathic nature. In conclusion, the three perennial grasses displayed distinct morphoecological traits. In order to achieve successful seed-based restoration of degraded African rangelands using native perennial grasses, careful selection species to maximize on their unique traits is recommended. Ultimately, this selection process should match the desired restoration outcomes and subsequent use of the rangeland. © Copyright © 2021 Mganga, Kaindi, Ndathi, Bosma, Kioko, Kadenyi, Musyoki, Wambua, van Steenbergen and Musimba.',\n",
       " 'We observed the surge velocity, terminus advance, lake formation and outburst, as well as its downstream impacts at Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram, Pakistan and suggest potential nature-based risk-reduction solutions. A recent surge started in late 2017 with increased velocity since April 2018 and a resulting terminus advance from June 2018. Bi-modal peak velocity of 19.2 ± 0.16 m/day was observed in April-May 2018 and May-June 2019. Also, the terminus advance blocked the river from the adjacent Muchuhar Glacier repeatedly since November 2018. Lake outbursts were observed in June 2019 and April 2020. Relying on observations of the lake area and peak discharge of 142 m3 s−1 in 2019 and 85 m3 s−1 April 2020, outburst were simulated using the BASEMENT software. Simulations and field observations show that even at high discharge, damages were mainly observed along the main river channel, causing strong bank erosion rather than widespread inundation of land. The ice-dammed lake is potentially hazardous until the blocked stream completely disappears in future. Our results suggest that the biggest lake outburst hazard lies in its erosion potential with damages to infrastructure closest to the river and large sediments transport to the downstream Hunza River. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'Planning discourse deeply influences urban responses to climate change, particularly within the context of the global south. This article examines urban climate action plans developed by 13 Indian cities to understand the different scenarios that shape policies and visions of urban governance, using discourse analysis. We find that the urban climate action agenda in India needs greater definitional clarity. Most plans require better contextual engagement with specific vulnerabilities in each city. City plans need to be better networked with state and national planning mechanisms, recognising that climate change requires multi-level governance responses. Finally, most plans consider Nature-Based Solutions only in the form of tree planting and waterbody management, lacking sufficient consideration of urban ecosystem function and process, and ecosystem-based restoration. These aspects require incorporation to help Indian cities become more effective at addressing urban climate challenges. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'There is growing interest in the application of nature-based solutions to adapt to climate change and promote resilience, yet barriers exist to their implementation. These include a perceived lack of evidence of their functioning in comparison to conventional solutions and an inability for existing design, policy, and assessment processes to capture the multiple benefits of these solutions. Positing this as a challenge of operationalizing and measuring resilience, we argue that the concept of resilience needs to be given concrete meaning in applied management contexts. Starting with shoreline vulnerability as a policy problem and natural and nature-based shoreline features as a promising solution, we present a case study of a co-creative process to produce an interdisciplinary and locally relevant approach to understanding and capturing the benefits of natural and nature-based solutions. We develop the notion of resilience service to enable a concreteness to resilience that simultaneously takes into account ecological, technical, and social dimensions. Through the co-creative process, our researcher-practitioner network developed a monitoring framework for shoreline features in New York State to facilitate the comparison of natural and nature-based features with conventional shoreline approaches. We describe the process and assess the advantages and drawbacks of integrating scientific input and local knowledge. We present the monitoring framework, showing how the co-creative character of the process is consequential in the formulation of the final framework through the selection of parameters, indicators, and protocols. We argue that interdisciplinarity, co-creation, pragmatism, multi-scalar applicability, and policy relevance are critical principles to understand the functioning and facilitate the implementation of nature-based solutions, while recognizing that this work necessitates compromise and as such will lead to continued deliberation. We posit this is a strength of the process for it acknowledges the creation of resilience as a social process in which values are central and subject to change. © 2021 by the author(s).',\n",
       " 'Erosion and landslides are frequent disasters in the Caribbean. The stabilisation of watercourses banks and the slopes of gullies are necessary to prevent erosion. Soil bioengineering offers more environmentally respectful solutions than traditional civil-engineering techniques in order to prevent soil erosion. Soil bioengineering includes vegetation as a building material. These techniques are not very widespread in the Caribbean and therefore basic research is necessary. Vegetative propagation is a low-cost, fast and effective way to obtain plant material. The development of soil bioengineering techniques also involves controlling species vegetative propagation. Appropriate species identification was conducted through literature review on the rooting ability of plant cuttings involving 31 Caribbean native herbaceous, shrubs and tree species adapted to riparian conditions. An ex situ study was carried out to evaluate the vegetative propagation potential of cuttings in the context of soil bioengineering development. Our results indicated that some native Caribbean species could be easily propagated through cuttings. Among the selected species; three trees, five shrubs and three herbaceous species were found to be easily adapted to the controlled propagation in low-tech conditions. It is consistent and suitable with soil bioengineering techniques in the Caribbean. © 2021 Forest Research Institute Malaysia. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'Nature‐based solutions (NbS) are recognized under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. This relatively new concept has become a key element in strategies for green recovery from the Covid‐19 pandemic. NbS consist of a range of measures that address various societal challenges, including climate change, natural disasters, and water security, by combining human well‐being and biodiversity benefits. Although the importance of NbS has been widely recognized, existing studies on aspects of their governance are limited and mainly focus on NbS in European countries. There is little relevant research in other regions, including Asia. This study aimed to explore challenges for NbS governance by analyzing the development and implementation of NbS in Asia. We focused on NbS in the fields of climate change mitigation and adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and infrastructure. In these three fields, NbS are linked to climate security issues and have been widely implemented in Asian countries. This analysis identified the challenges for NbS governance for countries at different stages of economic development, and for developing measures for NbS with different institutions and actors. It recognizes the importance of a framework that matches the need for NbS with relevant institutions and actors at various scales and in various sectors. Guidelines are required to integrate NbS into strategies and policies at national and local levels and also into international cooperation. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

       " 'With the emergence of the so-called Blue Economy, various conservation finance mechanisms and financial structures are being proposed as a means of simultaneously securing marine biodiversity and profit-making. A novel approach that is being applied within this new conservation finance frontier is the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance. By synthesizing recent literatures in political ecology on the notion of rent and the biopolitics of nature, this article explores how the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation and insurance can be seen as a technique that is mobilized for governing ecosystem rents biopolitically. The article urges political ecologists to pay attention to how biopolitics and governance of rents intersect in market-based environmental governance.While surveying the breadth of projects that involves both adaptation and insurance, I pay particular attention to a parametric coral reef insurance that was recently introduced in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. Such a project, this article argues, involves reconceptualizing the coral reef as an infrastructure that provides benefits – ultimately rents – to the local tourist industry and indirectly the state, but this coral infrastructure is itself in need of being protected through insurance as a biopolitical measure that can ensure the future life of the coral reef by rendering calculable uncertain, future climate threats to the reef. By reconceptualizing ecosystems as infrastructure that can be insured, the notion of ecosystem-based adaptation operationalizes otherwise systematic risks posed by climate change and biodiversity loss on a local scale. Finally, I highlight some of the complications that are involved when insurance is used as a biopolitical means of making nature live. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.',\n",
       " 'Sustainable urban water management initiatives are increasingly required to combat rapid urbanization and climate pressures. Initiatives include the role of tree planting, for which there is a need for strong evidence of benefits and drawbacks to support effective future planning. We report on the robustness of evidence from an assimilated database of urban hydrological impact studies which often had differing primary purposes. Consistent impacts were found at the local level, with trees reducing runoff and infiltration. Despite the consistency of evidence, much is undermined by the studies being somewhat lacking in robustness and scientific rigour. Many studies lack adequate controls, and models are often not strongly tested against observations. Moreover, evidence of impact at larger scales is lacking. Effects of tree characteristics were also investigated, such as maturity and species (for which evidence is consistent and detailed) and arrangement (for which there is less evidence). Realizing the full potential of trees in urban water management decision-making would benefit from more rigorous evidence. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'Due to hydrological dependencies within catchment areas, the development and implementation of urban flood risk policies require cooperation between upstream and downstream municipalities. Such cooperation may be difficult to realise in practice due to the diverging interests of these municipalities, which might result in upstream-downstream conflicts. In this paper, we aim to gain a better understanding of inter-municipal conflict and cooperation on flood risk policies for the Seveso River Basin in the Metropolitan City of Milan. The Transboundary Waters Interaction NexuS (TWINS) model is used to describe the evolution of conflict and cooperation, and the shift towards the securitisation of flood risk management in the basin. The politicised Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework is used to gain a better understanding of decision-making on Seveso flood risk policies. It is concluded that the ever-increasing frequency, and damage caused by flood events, together with an institutional setting which is characterised by power asymmetry between the Metropolitan City of Milan and upstream municipalities, and a dominant engineering resilience discourse have resulted in the securitisation of the Seveso’s issues. The securitisation is characterised by a closed decision-making process, which may explain the resistance by actors not involved in decision-making and thus, the emergence of new conflicts. © 2021.

A classification system is developed to assess the resilience of each component based on principles of ecosystem responses to long-term and unexpected environmental change. All infrastructure sectors have experienced long-term decline because of a patch and stabilize approach that excludes strengthen and innovate. Maria was the tipping point for system collapse. The weakest sector, however, is governance and an inability to change direction from traditional centralized, engineered approaches incapable of meeting current or projected changes in resource availability and societal needs. The two most resilient sectors are environment and human communities. Their strong interrelationship is key to developing decentralized, nature-based solutions to address immediate and projected threats to resiliency and sustainability of communities in Puerto Rico.

       " 'The global nature-climate crisis along with a fundamental shift in world population towards cities and towns has sharpened the focus on the role of urban green infrastructure. Green infrastructure has the potential to deliver cost-effective, naturebased solutions to help mitigate problems of climate change as well as provide improved human well-being through the ecosystem services inherent in landscapes rich in biodiversity. The absence of under-pinning science, specifically complex systems science and ecosystem theory in the design and planning of urban green infrastructure, has limited the capacity of these landscapes to deliver ecosystem services and to effectively demonstrate natural resilience to the impacts of climate change. To meet future challenges of environmental uncertainty and social change, the design of urban green space should embrace an adaptive ecosystem-based approach that includes fully integrated participatory planning and implementation strategies founded on principles of close to nature science. Our article offers two models to inform green space planning: urban green space framework and sustainable urban community network. Both concepts provide the foundation for six ecosystem-based design principles. In a case study on Essex green infrastructure, UK, recommendations made by the Essex Climate Action Commission to transform land management practices are presented as examples of adopting principles of the ecosystem approach and nature-based science. Our article concludes by emphasising the importance of reconnecting society with nature in cities through close-to-nature design of urban green space to secure essential ecosystem services and to build resilience to the impacts of climate change. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).',\n",
       " 'Learning from nature may be the most important step towards improving cities in the context of environmental and climate issues. However, many of the current approaches to make cities greener or more sustainable are still linear and insuffi-cient to deal with these growing challenges. In this scenario, the adoption of regenerative and circular lenses for the built environment may foster a more holistic development based on what is good rather than what is less bad. In this article, we propose that bioconnectivity or bioconnections—a nature‐focused approach based on biophilic design, biomimetics, and ecosystem services—may be an important enabler for the regeneration of the ecological and social boundaries of the planetary boundaries and doughnut economics models. We examine the literature to identify in what ways bioconnections could facilitate circular and regenerative processes for the local scale of the built environment domain. We complement the discussion with some real‐world examples from selected urban communities or interventions in existing urban areas around the globe that claim a green approach. In the end, we propose a framework of relevant bioconnections for the built environment that could facilitate addressing ecological and social boundaries at the local urban scale and facilitate processes of regenerative transitions towards thriving communities. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).',\n",
       " 'Understanding and explaining the use of green spaces and forests is challenging for sustainable urban planning. In recent years there has been increasing demand for novel approaches to investigate urban green infrastructure by capitalizing on large databases from existing citizen science tools. In this study, we analyzed iNaturalist data to perform an assessment of the intentional use of these urban spaces for their value and to understand the main drivers. We retrieved the total number of observations obtained across a set of 672 European cities and focused on reporting from mapped green areas and forests. We used two separate multivariate explanatory models to investigate which factors explained variations in the number of observations for green areas and forests. We found a relatively heterogeneous use of these two urban green spaces. Gross domestic product was important in explaining the number of visits. Availability and accessibility also had positive relationships with the use of green areas and forests in cities, respectively. This study paves the way for better integration of citizen science data in assessing cultural services provided by urban green infrastructure and therefore in supporting the evaluation of spatial planning policies for the sustainable development of urban areas. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'In Leipzig, despite strong growth, reurbanization and re-densification, in the last decade it has still been possible for the city to green brownfields with a new type of green space: urban forests. The background to this was of course the city’s decades of shrinkage and the emergence of numerous brownfields. The city of Leipzig started urban redevelopment in 2001 and pursued the strategy “more green, less density” in its planning. This included the creation of traditional and new green spaces as well as temporary uses. New green space concepts were also experimented with, including pocket forests and urban forests on larger, inner-city brownfields. This pursued several objectives: the forest was meant to contribute to improving the urban climatic and air-hygienic situation, to enhance the value of adjacent areas, create new recreational opportunities and contribute to increasing biodiversity. Another aspect is also the financing, for instance, the afforestation of brownfields is the cheapest way to create greenery. As a result of almost ten years of interdisciplinary monitoring of the project, it can now be stated that urban forests fulfil the objectives and are accepted and used by the population. Urban forests do not constitute an independent or new type of nature-based solutions they create new ecosystems from existing abandoned, brownfields, or neglected area. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The benefits of ‘green infrastructure’ are multi-faceted and well-documented, but estimating those of individual street-scale planting schemes at planning can be challenging. This is crucial to avoid undervaluing proposed schemes in cost–benefit analyses, and ensure they are resilient to ‘value engineering’ between planning and implementation. Here, we introduce prototype software enabling urban practitioners to estimate the site-specific air quality impacts of roadside vegetation barriers: highly localised changes in pollutant concentrations due to changes in the dispersion of vehicular emissions close to source. We summarise the recent shift in understanding regarding the impacts of vegetation on urban air pollution towards changes in pollutant dispersion (cf. deposition) and describe our prototype software, offering rapid estimates thereof. First tests of the underlying model’s performance are promising, reproducing: annual mean NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations in a street canyon (Marylebone Road, London, UK) to within 10% and 25%, respectively; and changes in pollutant concentrations of the right order of magnitude behind roadside barriers in a wind tunnel simulation of a street canyon and a real open-road environment. However, the model underestimates the benefits of a barrier in a simulated street canyon under perpendicular wind conditions. The prototype software is a first step towards informing practitioners of the site-specific impacts of vegetation barriers, which should always be additional to (i.e., no substitute for) essential emission reductions. The code is open-source to engage further researchers in its continued development. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",

Therefore, addressing the adaptation of educational buildings is crucial in avoiding these negative effects on school performance. In this paper, three educational buildings, located in Badajoz (Spain), Evora (Portugal) and Porto (Portugal), serve as pilot samples to study the suitability of nature-based solutions (NBS), chosen for each one of three climatic zones. The NBS selected include green roofs, vertical structures with vegetation to shade holes, outdoor trees and free-cooling ventilation. The scenarios of the different NBS implemented in the three models were simulated with the software EnergyPlus, which allows optimising the appropriate decision before renovation operations begin. The results obtained from the simulations suggest energy performance improvements after applying the most adequate NBS selection to each one of the three buildings tested. Particularly, a reduction in radiation on both roofs and facades is required in the case of Evora and Badajoz, where both climate zones have similar features, that is, warm and dry. While in Porto, milder and more humid than the former ones, it is very effective to operate mainly on the roof, complemented by small ventilation operations. © 2021 WIT Press.',\n",

IAM is an evolving field. We discuss this evolution and present our perspectives on the future direction of IAM. IAM was born as a response to the poor state of maintenance of infrastructure, largely due to lack of resources, and emphasizes the need to prioritize maintenance and renewal using risk-based approaches. The demands on IAM have also continued to evolve as asset systems have become more complex, with multifunctionality, adaptative capacity and nature-based infrastructure, all issues that IAM must now consider. These challenges underpin the changing context of Water Infrastructure Asset Management (WIAM) and the opportunity for WIAM to harness new technical developments from other IAM domains.

       " 'Green spaces (GSs) are significant, nature-based solutions to climate change and have immense potential to reduce vulnerability to heat waves while enhancing the resilience of urban areas in the light of climate change. However, in the Saudi context, the availability of GSs across cities and their perceived role in climate change mitigations and adaptation strategies remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine the per capita availability of GSs in the Jeddah megacity in Saudi Arabia, and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. This study assessed the per capita availability of GS in Jeddah city using GIS techniques, and a questionnaire survey (online and an onsite) was conducted to assess the GSs users’ perception of the role of GSs on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Non-parametric tests were also used to find differences in roles based on socio-demographic attributes. The findings of the study revealed that: (i) the per capita availability of GS in Jeddah is relatively low in comparison to international organization recommendations (such as World Health Organization and European Union). As per the survey result, it was reported that GSs play crucial role for climate change mitigation such as temperature regulation, reduction in heat stress, enhancement outdoor thermal comfort, and the maintenance of air quality. More than 85% of the total respondents agreed with the very high importance of GSs for climate change mitigation. More than 80% of respondents in the city highly agreed with climate change adaptation strategies such as the enhancement of accessibility to GSs, ecosystem-based protection of GSs, and the improvement of per capita availability of GSs. The findings of the study will be very helpful to planners and policymakers in implementing nature-based solutions to reduce vulnerability to climate change in Jeddah city, and particularly other cities in a desert environment. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'The aim of this paper is to mitigate hydrogeological risk, closely bound to climate change, through the forecast of green and blue infrastructures, basing the solutions mainly on nature-based solutions (NBS). A further aim is to restore the ecosystems of the landscapes and to allow the provision of various benefits to societies. The novelty of the paper is the application of a method that measures improvements from the point of view of flood mitigations by means of devices that, at the same time, decrease the hydraulic hazard and increase the urban endowments of settlements. Indeed, there is a new way of avoiding flooding involving nature as part of the solution as well as allowing for the provision of benefits to societies. A methodological analysis of the cases studied was carried out in order to achieve an actual diagnosis regarding the flooding risk of these landscapes so as to identify possible areas of intervention. The case-studies in Argentina and Italy are two small settlements that, although located in such distant and diverse places, have similarities in flood phenomena and in the relationship between urban fabric and waterway. In order to mitigate hydrogeological risk, through the provision of green and blue infrastructures, mainly through NBSs, a methodological tool to identify a range of possible interventions capable of mitigating the risk through territorial and urban planning of suitable “green and blue infrastructures” (GBIs) applying different NBSs has been developed. © 2021, Luciano Editore.

       " 'A corporate appetite for greenhouse gas reduction from nature-based solutions, in general, and REDD+, in particular, is driving a rapidly growing voluntary carbon market. The interest to invest in solutions that avoid or reduce deforestation holds the potential to significantly support national efforts to achieve the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals. However, controversy over leakage coupled with confusion and insufficient understanding of spill-over and displacement effects risk holding back necessary investments. This article seeks to shed light on different concepts surrounding leakage, including underlying dynamics and possible solutions on how to address them. In doing so, it makes the case for integrating avoided deforestation projects into national REDD+ strategies and highlights the need for a multi-level and multi-actor approach towards REDD+. Leakage occurs at all levels of implementation of REDD+ activities, at the project, programme and policy level, and both within and beyond national boundaries. Local leakage can largely be controlled through project design that analyses and addresses the proximate causes of leakage and underlying drivers, however, leakage is more difficult to avoid at the programme or policy level. Market leakage is particularly complex and harder to manage, but can–to a certain extent–be modelled and accounted for. Successful REDD+ efforts will combine demand-side measures with national or jurisdictional programmes that support governance reforms and integrate local investments in nature-based solutions and avoided deforestation projects. Key policy insights Emissions leakage is a ubiquitous phenomenon in climate mitigation that occurs at all levels of implementation. However, it is of particular concern in the case of REDD+, where reduced deforestation in one geographical area can lead to an increase in forest loss in another area. Leakage has to be managed and monitored at different scales: locally through avoided deforestation projects that address local drivers of deforestation; nationally through well-designed REDD+ policies; and internationally, among others, through demand-side standards in countries importing forest-risk commodities. Larger-scale programmes that link government interventions with efforts to eliminate deforestation from commodity supply chains, conservation efforts and avoided deforestation projects can limit leakage while helping to integrate various conservation and financing strategies. ‘Nesting’ of avoided deforestation projects into larger REDD+ programmes, at sub-national or national scale, allows for the integration of greenhouse gas accounting across different scales of implementation. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'Through a dialectical approach, building a thesis, an antithesis and a synthesis, our goal in this article is to discuss the implementation of the Parque Augusta, in the center of São Paulo, Brazil. For years, an organized social movement struggled with the municipality and real estate developers for the protection of the park and its green area. The demanded and desired park, collectively designed and managed, physically structured on the principles of the nature-based solutions (NBS), should represent a victory. However, in a capitalist urban space, the future park has already been appropriated in the real estate market to enhance development values and to increase the density of its environs with the construction of new skyscrapers. In a city tagging its climate actions using NBS concepts, the project in implementation by the municipality has fewer NBS elements than the co-designed with citizens participation. Here we present the narratives of the park creation and some indicators about its appropriation, based on land use and real estate market prices. The theoretical critical perspective was fundamental to reveal the contradictions within the park construction, called attention to the consideration of the surrounding area in greening projects and promoted a synthesis towards the universalization of the right to nature in the city. © 2021 by the author.

       " 'How are our cities confronting the challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and major resource depletion? ―This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of renaturalisiation and rewilding of cities. It introduces Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in urban planning that are integrated with the aim to enhance urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity decline, which can be applied in two areas: through the conception of new green neighbourhoods; and through the regeneration and re-greening of existing but neglected parts of the city, such as postindustrial brownfields or economically weak districts. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing and a good quality of life. Green spaces in cities –big or small– all contribute to health and wellbeing. However, many cities, including in the U.S. and in Europe, do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving better access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks will deliver a large number of benefits, such as ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, with the potential to restore damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microclimate. As most of our cities keep growing and warming, the scale of the issue is significant. For example, in 2020, cities in the European Union were home to over 70 percent of Europe’s population, and this figure is expected to increase to over 80 percent by the middle of the century. This translates to 36 million new urban citizens in Europe by 2050 alone, who will need housing, employment, health care and access to green spaces (EU-Commission, 2018). In this context, nature-based solutions and re-greening can generate significant benefits for citizens, improve urban health and well-being, and offer an opportunity to effectively deploy nature in helping to resolve major societal challenges ―such as social inclusion, food security and disaster risk reduction. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of NBS is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors. © The author; licensee Universidad de la Costa - CUC.',\n",
       " 'Climate change and the need for sustainable development have been reflected in a proliferation of climate adaptation interventions, especially in the Global South. However, alongside intensified funding flows aimed at climate change adaptation, increased efforts in planning, monitoring, and evaluating of projects are necessary to avoid ineffective interventions or maladaptive outcomes. Yet, often the analytical tools available to the policy maker do not capture the cognitive and affective processes leading to adaptation decisions. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a conceptual framework for planning, monitoring, and evaluating climate adaptation interventions that draws upon the decision-making literature. The framework enables tracing how extrinsic factors (personal and external environment characteristics) and intrinsic factors (knowledge and attitudes) influence the decision to participate in an intervention and its outcomes. The paper provides detailed guidelines on how to apply the framework and demonstrates its use in an in-depth case study of a tree planting intervention in Ghana. © 2021 The Author(s)',\n",

Potentially our urban living labs have opened up opportunities for local planners to discuss controversial issues by using the idea of nature based solution as a boundary-object/trading-zone. On the other hand, planners’ positivistic and incremental understanding of city making hinders a transformative understanding of the urban living lab and nature based solution in favour of more fashionable technological fixes. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'In this article a planning approach is proposed to accommodate different paces of urbanisation. Instead of responding to a single problem with a Pavlov-type of response, analysis shows that the transformational tempi of different urban landscapes require multiple deployment strategies to develop urban environments that are sustainable and resilient. The application of nature-based solutions, enhancing both human and natural health in cities, is used as the foundation for the design of deployment strategies that respond to different paces of urban change. The results show that urban characteristics, such as population density and built space is, partly, dependent on the underlying landscape characteristics, therefore show specific development pathways. To create liveable and sustainable urban areas that can deal holistically with a range of intertwined problems, specific deployment strategies should be used in each specific urban context. This benefits the city-precinct as a whole and at the local scale. Even small nature-based solutions, applied as the right deployment strategy in the right context, have profound impact as the starting point of a far-reaching urban transformation. The case-study for Oimachi in Japan illustrates how this planning approach can be applied, how the different urban rhythms are identified, and to which results this leads. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).',\n",
       " \"Municipal water sectors shift from building traditional grey stormwater infrastructure to ambitious plans for holistic blue–green infrastructure due to climate vulnerability. The shift requires new ways of thinking, working, and collaborating, and we need to understand and address the new planning challenges the shift creates. While existing stormwater literature explores a range of technical, institutional, and ﬁnancial barriers to alternative stormwater implementation, we hold the shift requires a deeper understanding of holistic and flexible stormwater management approaches. In this context, we investigate adaptive challenges like norms, practices, uncertainty, and new ways of collaborating across sectors in alternative stormwater planning in Norway. The studied planning processes exemplify how the need for making stormwater measures legally binding in municipal planning changes work practices in municipal water sectors. A novelty of the paper is that it shows how water departments take leadership of formal planning processes and adopt the planning department's language and working methods. We find that the studied municipalities promote cross-sectoral collaborative approaches that create space for professional negotiation and mediation and invite a deeper understanding of other's interests and views. We hold that such approaches could contribute to more holistic and flexible planning approaches, securing long-term sustainable stormwater management. © 2021 The Author(s).

The influence of season variations on the abundance of fecal indicator organisms (total coliforms and Escherichia coli) in the wastewater and in the substrate and the roots of plants inhabiting the inlet and outlet zones of the CW was evaluated along three consecutive years. The structure and diversity of bacterial communities associated to the CW’s substrate of inlet and outlet zones was also analyzed overtime. Wastewater was characterized for physicochemical and microbiological parameters and the bacterial communities colonizing the substrate surface, were analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). The CW was effective in removing COD, BOD5, TSS, PO43−, NH4+, NO3−, and NO2− . It was also effective in removing fecal indicators, with a generalized decrease of total coliforms and E. coli in the substrate and in the wastewater from inlet to outlet of up to 2–3 log. The structure and composition of bacterial communities associated with the substrate was mainly influenced by the year rather than by the season or the CW zone. © 2021 by the authors.

       " 'It is time to move beyond the era of conflict and develop a new shared vision for the management of Australia’s public forests. We need more holistic approaches that encompass all forest values across the landscape, rather than the current approach of dividing public forest management up across different government agencies. More collaborative approaches will be required to galvanise the resources, skills and knowledge that enables this shift in shared governance. Recent bushfires in Australia have heightened concerns that the management of public forest lands has largely failed to ensure the health of forest ecosystems, build resilience, and secure a promised balance between economic, social and environmental values. Investment in efforts to adapt forest management to address climate change has been limited; and empowering and increasing the role of Indigenous Australians in forest management could be significantly improved. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to improve the resilience of regional communities to major shocks and stresses caused by factors that encompass market dynamics, supply-chain disruptions and natural disasters. Three key strategies are proposed to strengthen forest management in Australia: first, establishing new shared governance models that bring together government agencies with Indigenous Australians and actors from the private sector and civil society; second, extending active and adaptive management across forest landscapes that builds resilience in our forests, local communities and society; and third, integrating traditional knowledge with scientific evidence and innovative technologies to enhance forest management for improved resilience and other outcomes. © 2021 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).',\n",
       " 'Background: Agro-biodiversity is one of the most important issues under the Convention on Biological Diversity (hereinafter as the Convention), and it is of practical significance to global food security, sustainable development of agriculture and realization of carbon neutrality. However, research has shown that due to the continuous population growth and fundamental changes in dietary structure, continued expansion of agriculture has become one of the principal drivers of biodiversity loss. Content: This paper systematically reviews the development and processes of the main negotiating topics of agro-biodiversity through a comprehensive analysis of the provisions of the Convention, the decisions and recommendations of previous Conferences of Parties (from COP2 to COP14), the assessment report of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 (GBO-5) published by the United Nations Environment Programme and Convention on Biological Diversity, the consultation on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and the progress of convention performing on agro-biodiversity. In light of this review, we provide an analysis of the global challenges of agro-biodiversity and recommendations to meet those challenges. Achievements: This paper describes a comprehensive overview of the decisions and recommendations from COP2 to COP14, and assesses the qualitative and quantitative indicators related to Goal 9 of the “Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework”. The topic of agricultural biodiversity is thoroughly analyzed across scales, from broad goals to concrete examples. These span the initial “genetic resources” to “protection and sustainable utilization”, and involve multi-dimensional topics, such as soil, pollination, trade, energy, nutrition and health. On the premise of ensuring national food security, this paper shows that China has actively participated in the implementation of agricultural biodiversity and achieved positive results. Recommendation: In light of continued challenges in agro-biodiversity, the following reasonable suggestions are developed for the improvement of agricultural biodiversity in China. (1) Studying the agro-biodiversity indicators in more depth, taking into account the reality of global development and promoting the implementation required and optional solutions. (2) Taking advantage of nature-based solutions (NbS) to solve the problems of agro-biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation in a coordinated way. (3) Keeping in step with the international performance trend, and building multilateral partnerships to achieve the green and sustainable agricultural development. (4) Encouraging the integration of agro-biodiversity protection into enterprise development plans to promote the participation of all stakeholders. These findings and suggestions will contribute to the maintenance of agricultural stability and food security, and lay a foundation for the success and outcome of the Fifteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Convention (COP15). © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

       " 'Background: The 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) will review the achievement and delivery of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and consider adopting the final draft of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework with potential amendments. The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework will be an important milestone toward the realization of the 2050 vision “living in harmony with nature” and achieving the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Progress: It is agreed that the financial mechanism for supporting biodiversity conservation is and will continue to be the key to implementing the global biodiversity action plan. However, the current funding gap for biodiversity conservation and restoration to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 is estimated to be at least 50 billion US dollars per year, with an even larger financial gap of more than half a trillion US dollars per year expected in the coming decade. According to the data submitted to the Clearing-House Mechanism (CHM) of the CBD, parties’ direct investment for domestic biodiversity conservation only accounts for a very small fraction of their total gross domestic product (GDP). In 2015, China spent 0.255% of its total GDP in biodiversity conservation, and this percentage was relatively high compared to other countries. As a developing country, China has significantly increased its biodiversity investment in recent years, and in 2019 this amount reached approximately 0.6% of its GDP. The existing biodiversity funding channel is relatively low on diversity, which will make fulfilling biodiversity conservation goals quite challenging. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish a new funding mechanism to assist in the achievement of the post-2020 mission and goals by 2030. It has been suggested that the Convention on Biological Diversity can learn from the financial mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (e.g. green climate fund), and synergize with other relevant environmental conventions, in particular, through nature-based solutions. Perspective: As the host country of COP15, China has the responsibility and ability to facilitate the negotiation for a new funding mechanism at the conference in order to promote the implementation of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. This new biodiversity funding mechanism shall be independent of the existing financial mechanisms with much diverse investment channels, introduce achievement grading mechanisms and link funding to concrete mission, goal and responsibility aiming to improve the efficiency of fund use, and support biodiversity activities in developing countries. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

       " \"In recent years, nature-based solutions are receiving increasing attention in the field of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation as inclusive, no regret approaches. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) can mitigate the impacts of climate change, build resilience and tackle environmental degradation thereby supporting the targets set by the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework. Despite these benefits, EbA is still rarely implemented in practice. To better understand the barriers to implementation, this research examines policy-makers' perceptions of EbA, using an extended version of Protection Motivation Theory as an analytical framework. Through semi-structured interviews with policy-makers at regional and provincial level in Central Vietnam, it was found that EbA is generally considered a promising response option, mainly due to its multiple ecosystem-service benefits. The demand for EbA measures was largely driven by the perceived consequences of natural hazards and climate change. Insufficient perceived response efficacy and time-lags in effectiveness for disaster risk reduction were identified as key impediments for implementation. Pilot projects and capacity building on EbA are important means to overcome these perceptual barriers. This paper contributes to bridging the knowledge-gap on political decision-making regarding EbA and can, thereby, promote its mainstreaming into policy plans. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\",\n",

Based on interviews and desktop research, we analyzed overall framework conditions in these countries as well as implementation practices in three cities. Our findings demonstrate that the main problem was the deficit of strategic foresight for urban development. SUDS are mostly promoted by NGOs and fueled by international donors, and this represents a major barrier to their implementation, as NGOs and ‘traditional’ epistemic communities are often not connected. Successful examples of SUDS are missing, often due to regulatory environments forcing SUDS development teams to take suboptimal decisions. In order to be taken seriously by key stakeholders SUDS need to appear in national policy documents. Furthermore, the overall successful implementation of SUDS needs robust governance frameworks while many structural issues are direct results of governance deficits. © 2021 The Author(s).

       " 'Urban green spaces reduce elevated urban temperature through evaporative cooling and shading and are thus promoted as nature-based solutions to enhance urban climates. However, in growing cities, the supply of urban green space often conflicts with increasing housing demand. This study investigates the interplay of densification and the availability of green space and its impact on human heat stress in summer. For the case of an open-midrise (local climate zone 5) urban rede velopment site in Munich, eight densification scenarios were elaborated with city planners and evaluated by microscale simulations in ENVI-met. The chosen scenarios consider varying building heights, different types of densification, amount of vegetation and parking space regulations. The preservation of existing trees has the greatest impact on the physical equivalent temperature (PET). Construction of underground car parking results in the removal of the tree population. Loss of all the existing trees due to parking space consumption leads to an average daytime PET increase of 5°C compared to the current situation. If the parking space requirement is halved, the increase in PET can be reduced to 1.3°C-1.7°C in all scenarios. The addition of buildings leads to a higher gain in living space than the addition of floors, but night-time thermal comfort is affected by poor ventilation if fresh air circulation is blocked. The protection of mature trees in urban redevelopment strategies will become more relevant in the changing climate. Alternative mobility strategies could help to reduce trade-offs between densification and urban greening. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).',\n",
       " 'The concept of ecosystem service (ES) identifies benefits that people obtain from ecosystems with contributions to human well-being. One important ES under external pressure is “flood regulation” that describes an ecosystem’s capacity to reduce flood hazards. Several related studies estimate current flood regulation ES. However, regional climate projections indicate a shift in precipitation patterns. Therefore, Climate and land use changes make it necessary to assess future supply in order to test functionality and adaptation measures. This study focuses on surface retention ES. We used two methods to show the relevance of different landscape scenarios and climate information for flood regulation ES supply: 1) hydraulic simulations with the model HEC-RAS 2) the flood retention capacity indicator suggested by the German MAES-Working group. We simulated two events: the historic flood of 2013 and future hypothetically 10% higher water levels. Furthermore, three land use change scenarios were evaluated. The model results indicate water accumulation by vegetation. Higher water levels of future climate scenarios lead to an increase in flooded areas and higher water volumes. To evaluate flood regulation capacities, an approach solely based on 2D retention areas, such as the MAES-indicator, is not sufficient.

However, it is known that the performance of green roofs varies depending on the type of vegetation and, in drier climates, without resorting to irrigation, these are limited to xerophytic plant species and biocrusts. The aim of this research was therefore to compare differently vegetated green roofs planted with this type of vegetation. A particular focus was their ability to hold water during intense stormwater events and also the quality of the harvested rainwater. Six test beds with different vegetation compositions were used on the roof of a building in Lisbon. Regarding stormwater retention, the results varied depending on the composition of the vegetation and the season. As for water quality, almost all the parameters tested were higher than the Drinking Water Directive from the European Union (EU) and Word Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking-water quality standards for potable water. Based on our results, biocrusts and xerophytic vegetation are a viable green roof typology for slowing runoff during stormwater events. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",

       " 'As a nature-based solution, development of urban blue-green spaces is widely accepted for mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. It is of great significance to determine the main driving factors of the park cool island (PCI) effect for optimizing park layout and achieving a maximum cooling benefit of urban parks. However, there have been obviously controversial conclusions in previous studies due to varied case contexts. This study was conducted in Wuhan, a city with high water coverage, which has significant differences in context with the previous case cities. The PCI intensity and its correlation with park characteristics were investigated based on remote sensing data. The results indicated that 36 out of 40 urban parks expressed a PCI effect, with a PCI intensity of 0.08~7.29◦C. As expected, larger parks with enough width had stronger PCI intensity. An increased density of hardened elements in a park could significantly weaken PCI effect. Noticeably, in this study, water bodies in a park contributed the most to the PCI effect of urban parks, while the vegetated areas showed a negative impact on the PCI intensity. It implied that in a context with higher water coverage, the cooling effect of vegetation was weakened or even masked by water bodies, due to the interaction effect of different variables on PCI intensity. © 2020 by the authors.

       " \"Ecohydrology is the most basic science for guiding integrated watershed management. Rapid urbanization permanently alters land cover and the structure and functions of terrestrial ecosystems in a short period of time. Consequently, urbanization affects hvdrological processes such as surface evaporation, runoff, and local and regional climate, and ecosystem services (e.g., water supply, carbon sequestration, biodiversity). Urbanization directly affects the physical properties of the near-surface atmosphere, the energy exchange between land and atmosphere, and the water budget of the ecosystems. These changes bring or aggravate a series of water quantity, water quality, and climatic effects, e.g., heat island, dry island, wet island, rain island, and turbid island. This study systematically summarized the research progress in understanding the impacts of urbanization on watershed ecohvdrological processes with a focus on the consequences of urbanization on surface energy balance, water balance, water quality and aquatic organisms, and the meteorological effects of urban land use/cover change. The most direct impact of urban land use/cover change on the environment is the alternation of the energy and water balance at multiple scales. The unique physical properties of the urban surface and associated energy balance distribution characteristics are different from natural ecosystems, resulting in unique microclimate and eco-hydrology in an urban environment. Urbanization-driven surface processes have direct or indirect impacts on hydrological processes such as runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and river network confluence at different scales by increasing impervious surface and changing vegetation cover conditions. Large-scale urbanization aggravates the peak flow, rainstorm runoff, and annual total water yield as a result of evapotranspiration reduction caused by the significant reduction of vegetation and surface soil infiltration rate. The influence of urbanization on non-point source water pollution is mainly reflected in the change of ' source' , ' process' , and ' sink' of non-point source pollutants. Urbanization aggravates water quality problems by the increase in impervious surface that elevates pollutant concentration and load and alters physical and chemical processes in aquatic systems. Large-scale conversion of forest lands to urban uses leads to a significant reduction in evapotranspiration, which reduces its ' biological drainage ' function, coupled with an increase in the impervious surface, and is likely to exacerbate the risk of flooding or the risk of ' light rainstorms, heavy waterlogging' phenomena in urban watersheds. The conversions of vegetated ecosystems reduce their ' air conditioner' functions and are likely to exacerbate the ' urban heat island' and ' urban dry island' effects. We summarized measures and strategies centered on ' Low Impact Development' to mitigate the urbanization risks through reducing extreme hydrological effects of impervious surface, enhancing the regulating function of natural ecosystems, and implementing the Urban Best Management Practices at a watershed scale. We concluded that future urban ecohydrological science should focus on the studying the mechanisms of ' Low Impact Development ' and ' Nature-based Solutions ' in mitigating environmental impacts from the perspectives of water and energy balances and biogeochemical cycling at multiple scales. © 2021 Science Press.

       " 'Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have recently gained traction as integrated approaches that can address societal challenges by simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. Among the benefits of NBS, their capacity to address urban water challenges – such as inland and coastal flooding –while providing ecological benefits has been a recent area of focus globally. While interventions that are labelled ‘Nature-Based Solutions’ have been widely integrated into policy and practice in Europe, the term has not been extensively adopted in Australian policy and praxis. This research examines how Australian water professionals from research and practice understand, conceptualise and use the concept, ‘Nature-Based Solutions’ (NBS) in addressing urban water challenges. We interviewed 27 water professionals in research and practice with diverse disciplinary backgrounds across four Australian states and asked them to provide their definition of NBS. The results show that alternative terminologies such as Green Infrastructure and Water Sensitive Urban Design are predominantly used. We present the participants’ perspectives on the adoption of this term in Australia, and discuss the value and contributions of NBS as an umbrella concept. We conclude by providing insights on the potentials and limitations of the term, and propose ways to move beyond a focus on terminology and definitions towards facilitating the uptake and implementation of NBS in our cities. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH',\n",

While policymakers warm to these ‘nature-based solutions’, their successful implementation will depend on the public’s capacity to care for trees and spaces of (urban) nature. This underscores the importance of understanding what drives people to voluntarily care for trees and (urban) natures on public and private land. In conversation with existing research on urban forestry and environmental volunteerism, this paper tests the proposition that attention to atmospheres could enrich our knowledge of the forces that mediate care and volunteer motivation. Its novel empirical contribution is a description of the aesthetic, affective and semiotic contours of two arboreal atmospheres called grace and vibrancy. The paper concludes by reflecting on the connection between these atmospheres and participants’ capacity to care for the urban forest.

       " 'Biogeomorphology has been expanding as a discipline, due to increased recognition of the role that biology can play in geomorphic processes, as well as due to our increasing capacity to measure and quantify feedback between biological and geomorphological systems. Here, we provide an overview of the growth and status of biogeomorphology. This overview also provides the context for introducing this special issue on biogeomorphology, and specifically examines the thematic domains of biogeomorphological research, methods used, open questions and conundrums, problems encountered, future research directions, and practical applications in management and policy (e.g. nature-based solutions). We find that whilst biogeomorphological studies have a long history, there remain many new and surprising biogeomorphic processes and feedbacks that are only now being identified and quantified. Based on the current state of knowledge, we suggest that linking ecological and geomorphic processes across different spatio-temporal scales emerges as the main research challenge in biogeomorphology, as well as the translation of biogeomorphic knowledge into management approaches to environmental systems. We recommend that future biogeomorphic studies should help to contextualize environmental feedbacks by including the spatio-temporal scales relevant to the organism(s) under investigation, using knowledge of their ecology and size (or metabolic rate). Furthermore, in order to sufficiently understand the ‘engineering’ capacity of organisms, we recommend studying at least the time period bounded by two disturbance events, and recommend to also investigate the geomorphic work done during disturbance events, in order to put estimates of engineering capacity of biota into a wider perspective. Finally, the future seems bright, as increasingly inter-disciplinary and longer-term monitoring are coming to fruition, and we can expect important advances in process understanding across scales and better-informed modelling efforts. © 2020 The Authors.

       " 'An exemplar of nature-based solutions (NBS) is natural flood management (NFM), for which interest is growing worldwide. As with many NBS, implementing NFM requires the participation of support of multiple stakeholders. However, we lack understanding about the views and expectations of the many stakeholders who might be expected to enable or implement it. Understanding such views may offer insights regarding whether and how the dominant flood risk management protection paradigm is really being challenged. Using the first survey (N = 118) across a range of water and environmental management stakeholders in the United Kingdom (UK), this research explores whether there is support for a paradigm shift to “work with nature” as intended with NBS. We find evidence that some stakeholders view NFM as a “no-brainer”; a judgement based on perceived cost-effectiveness, social and environmental benefits and the failure of the protection paradigm exposed in recent floods. Others, typically farmers and landowners, have more cautious views about change. All our respondents generally agree that responsibility to enable, implement, and fund NFM should be shared across society, but disagreements remain about the detail and the basis for any enabling payments. We argue that the shared perception of roles and responsibilities provides a foundation for further work to facilitate NFM, explicitly considering principles and specific contractual details. In the UK, the possibilities of post-Brexit agri-environment policy make such a debate particularly pertinent. It is also likely to be productive in many other cases and places, since the paradigm shift entailed by ideal visions of NBS often entails new relationships between stakeholders and new activities ‘on the ground’. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

The benefits of NBS are recognized, and include improved quality of life, human health and air quality, amongst others. This study aims to assess how NBS can contribute to temperature attenuation and air quality improvement in the city of Eindhoven (The Netherlands), through the application of the state-of-the-art WRF-Chem online air quality modelling system. The city is thereby characterized in terms of air quality related data, such as climatology, atmospheric emissions and air pollutant concentrations. From this assessment, different NBS were selected according to city aspirations. The WRF-Chem model was applied for baseline and NBS scenarios over the study area with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km and an hourly time resolution for August 2013. The baseline scenario (without NBS) was validated by comparing the model results with monitored data retrieved from the European air quality monitoring database, showing an adequate model performance. The scenario simulations (with NBS) were performed by changing the land use in the model setup, and results were compared with the baseline scenario. Reductions in hourly temperature values of approximately 1 °C and reductions in pollutant concentrations, namely nitrogen dioxide (NO2), of approximately 10% were estimated after the application of the NBS in the Eindhoven study area.

       " 'The 2018 edition of the United Nations World Water Development Report stated that nearly 6 billion peoples will suffer from clean water scarcity by 2050. This is the result of increasing demand for water, reduction of water resources, and increasing pollution of water, driven by dramatic population and economic growth. It is suggested that this number may be an underestimation, and scarcity of clean water by 2050 may be worse as the effects of the three drivers of water scarcity, as well as of unequal growth, accessibility and needs, are underrated. While the report promotes the spontaneous adoption of nature-based-solutions within an unconstrained population and economic expansion, there is an urgent need to regulate demography and economy, while enforcing clear rules to limit pollution, preserve aquifers and save water, equally applying everywhere.

       " 'Oyster reefs have the potential as eco-engineers to improve coastal protection. A field experiment was undertaken to assess the benefit of oyster breakwater reefs to mitigate shoreline erosion in a monsoon-dominated subtropical system. Three breakwater reefs with recruited oysters were deployed on an eroding intertidal mudflat at Kutubdia Island, the southeast Bangladesh coast. Data were collected on wave dissipation by the reef structures, changes in shoreline profile, erosion-accretion patterns, and lateral saltmarsh movement and related growth. This was done over four seasons, including the rainy monsoon period. The observed wave heights in the study area ranged 0.1–0.5 m. The reefs were able to dissipate wave energy and act as breakwaters for tidal water levels between 0.5–1.0 m. Waves were totally blocked by the vertical relief of the reefs at water levels <0.5 m. On the lee side of the reefs, there was accretion of 29 cm clayey sediments with erosion reduction of 54% as compared to control sites. The changes caused by the deployed reefs also facilitated seaward expansion of the salt marsh. This study showed that breakwater oyster reefs can reduce erosion, trap suspended sediment, and support seaward saltmarsh expansion demonstrating the potential as a nature-based solution for protecting the subtropical coastlines. © 2019, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Nature-based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly promoted to support sustainable and resilient urban planning. However, design and planning urban NBS targeted at the needs of the local context require knowledge about the causal relationships between NBS, ecosystem services (ES) and urban challenges (UC) This paper aims at contributing to this knowledge, by systematically identifying nexuses (i.e. qualitative links) between UC, ES and NBS, and describing plausible causal relationships. A conceptual UC-ES-NBS criteria framework was built, and used to guide a two-step systematic literature review on current UC and on the supply of ES by urban NBS. This was followed by a non-systematic literature review, which complemented the previous one by unveiling knowledge gaps on the biophysical and social processes and attributes on which specific ES classes depend. The non-systematic review was also used to identify additional NBS. The UC review identified 18 UC and 58 sub-challenges, and illustrated which UC were more studied, according to the type of literature and environmental and socio-economic attributes of urban contexts. The ES review led to the development of an urban NBS classification, and supported the identification of UC-ES and ES-NBS nexuses, which were analysed and classified into four groups of causal relationship. For the nexuses identified as direct plausible causal relationship, the main processes and attributes on which the supply of specific ES depend were pointed out. Relationships between UC, ES, NBS, processes, and attributes were represented in the form of network diagrams. Our results can be used to support urban policies aimed at mainstreaming NBS and as a basis to further understand UC-ES-NBS relationships. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Soil protection and sustainable agriculture have become a key issue in Common Agricultural Policy. Emphasis is being placed on climate-smart agriculture, nature-friendly agricultural technologies and implementation of a range of nature-based measures to protect soil, retain water in landscape, etc. Recent agricultural policy is mostly based on qualitative assessment of the current state and impacts of technologies. Economic assessment is still missing, although subsidies and other forms of financial support are provided from both national and European Union funds. Externalities in agriculture not only generate social costs and profits for the current generation but also strongly affect future well-being. The objective of this paper is to present a newly developed approach that enables monetary assessment of externalities in agriculture. The process of monetary assessment means inclusion and calculation of all costs and benefits, including positive and negative externalities going beyond financial revenue. The methodology is based on modified cost–benefit analysis using the concept of ecosystem services. The proposed method is demonstrated on a case study in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. This region has been struggling with drought in the last few years, but its agricultural technologies are not adapted and appropriate nature-based solutions are not implemented. Economic analysis focuses on assessment of externalities and possible measures. It covers operating and investment costs; the loss of profits due to decreasing production; and benefits consisting mainly of prevented loss of regulating services. The results show that implementation of measures is always preferable regardless of climate change and avoids society loss. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).',\n",
       " 'Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) are of major environmental concern for impacted surface waterbodies. In the last decades, major storm events have become increasingly regular in some areas, and meteorological scenarios predict a further rise in their frequency. Consequently, control and treatment of CSOs with respect to best practice examples, innovative treatment solutions, and management of sewer systems are an inevitable necessity. As a result, the number of publications concerning quality, quantity, and type of treatments has recently increased. This review therefore aims to provide a critical overview on the effects, control, and treatment of CSOs in terms of impact on the environment and public health, strict measures addressed by regulations, and the various treatment alternatives including natural and compact treatments. Drawing together the previous studies, an innovative treatment and control guideline are also proposed for the better management practices. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.',\n",
       " 'Living shorelines are being widely implemented to mitigate shoreline erosion and provide ecosystem services, but how they interact with waves remains poorly understood. Wave transmission through living shoreline breakwalls is studied using field observations and theoretical approaches. The following hypotheses are tested: (i) living shoreline breakwalls can act as buffers against waves; (ii) wave transmission through these nature-based solutions is modulated by tides; and (iii) wave transmission through living shoreline breakwalls is similar to the behavior observed in waves through porous breakwaters. Observations were collected in intertidal settings where boat wakes and tides are the major flow components. Nearly 1000 boat wakes were identified in the observations using advanced time-frequency data analysis methods. Wave transmission through the breakwalls composed of tree branches was quantified and modulation of this process by tides was investigated. The two tested breakwall designs provided different behaviors of wave transmission. In the first design with an estimated porosity of 0.7 where the tree branches were bundled, transmission rates were found to vary mostly between 9% and 70% and had an average of 53%. Transmission increased with increasing water depth especially at mid-tide and low-tide where the height of the breakwall relative to depth was between 0.5 and 1. In the second design with an estimated porosity of 0.9 where the tree branches were not bundled, transmission rates exceeded 70% in 84% of the cases, sometimes reaching 100% transmission, and had an average of 83% with much less variability with depth compared to the first design. Wave transmission estimates based on theory of porous media were found to be most sensitive to breakwall porosity and the friction coefficient. Best agreement between the observed and theoretical estimates of wave transmission was found using a turbulent friction coefficient of 2.7, the median value of the most common range given in the literature on waves through porous media. The highest discrepancy between observed and theoretical estimates of wave transmission occurs at shallow depths when the breakwall emerged. In these conditions, the theory overestimates transmitted wave energy, most likely due to significant wave breaking and bottom friction in shallow water. The findings support our hypotheses that well-engineered semi-porous living shorelines act as buffers against human-mediated boat traffic and waves, and their related performance in dissipating wave energy and sustaining coastal ecosystems is modulated by depth. The results can be used as guidelines for design of living shorelines for given wave climate and breakwall properties. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Online knowledge-sharing platforms could potentially contribute to an accelerated climate adaptation by promoting more green and blue spaces in urban areas. The implementation of small-scale nature-based solutions (NBS) such as bio(swales), green roofs, and green walls requires the involvement and enthusiasm of multiple stakeholders. This paper discusses how online citizen science platforms can stimulate stakeholder engagement and promote NBS, which is illustrated with the case of ClimateScan. Three main concerns related to online platforms are addressed: the period of relevance of the platform, the lack of knowledge about the inclusiveness and characteristics of the contributors, and the ability of sustaining a well-functioning community with limited resources. ClimateScan has adopted a “bottom–up” approach in which users have much freedom to create and update content. Within six years, this has resulted in an illustrated map with over 5000 NBS projects around the globe and an average of more than 100 visitors a day. However, points of concern are identified regarding the data quality and the aspect of community-building. Although the numbers of users are rising, only a few users have remained involved. Learning from these remaining top users and their motivations, we draw general lessons and make suggestions for stimulating long-term engagement on online knowledge-sharing platforms. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Plant-based technologies including phytomining, phytoextraction, phytodegradation, phytostabilization and phytovolatilization have drawn much attention during the last decade. To examine the feasibility of these nature-based solutions to accumulate, degrade, stabilize or volatize metal(loid)s and/or organic contaminants, an increasing number of field studies have been conducted. This review critically evaluates influencing factors in phytomining and phytoremediation approaches, including contaminant concentrations, fertilizer application and chelating agent addition, planting characteristics (e.g. plant density, seeding, cropping and harvesting methods), and soil properties (e.g. salinity, soil texture and soil pH). A proper trial design will assure the robustness of the results if these factors were taken into consideration seriously. We also summarized knowledge about additives used in field trials, especially biological waste-derived amendments such as biochar, compost, sewage sludge and manure. According to the literature reviewed, controversy remains whether these amendments can promote the plant performance. In addition, the utilization of microorganisms and transgenic plants in field trials, and the associated biosafety concerns such as horizontal gene transfer were discussed. Future research should examine the ecological risks associated with phytomining and phytoremediation (e.g. the secondary migration of contaminants due to improper handling of harvested plants). It is suggested that the results of field studies should guide commercial applications of phytomining and phytoremediation. (Figure presented.). © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.',\n",
       " 'Embedding nature-based solutions (NBS) in cities is expected to bring quantifiable benefits, including resilience to flooding, drought, and heatwaves, and air quality improvement. Among NBS, green roofs have an important role in temperature regulation in buildings and in lowering the damaging effects of heatwaves on human health. In this paper a spatial microsimulation model is implemented to simulate temperature impacts of green roofs installations in cities and their capacity to attenuate the effects of heatwave episodes. Particularly vulnerable to heatwaves are elderly people with limited mobility, who have limited means to seek cooling and create cooler indoor environments. The model, implemented using the Netlogo platform (version 6.0.4), considers as agents the elderly citizens in a city area and simulates the heatwave-related health impacts, which are measured in mortality likelihood. In particular, the model simulates a generalised 1.5 °C to 3 °C indoor temperature reduction range induced by green roofs (based on inferences from green roof literature) in four different European cities: Szeged (Hungary), Alcalá de Henares (Spain), Metropolitan City of Milan (Italy) and Çankaya municipality (Turkey). The simulation utilises a ceteris paribus modelling approach, meaning that the relationships of the observed phenomenon (mortality induced by heatwaves) with other possible influencing factors (e.g. level of sport and physical activities practiced by people) are not taken into account. In the case of Szeged, Alcalá de Henares, and Çankaya municipality a substantial reduction in mortality is found to occur associated with green roofs roll out. In the case of the Metropolitan city of Milan, green roofs installations show a low mitigation effect in some scenarios. The underlying factor is the temperature threshold parameter of the model, above which heatwave mortality occurs. This parameter was inferred from the literature (Baccini M., et al., 2008) and it resulted to be substantially higher in the Metropolitan city of Milan (31.8 °C) than in the other cities. The simulation helps in obtaining results which are specific to a given city and particular scenarios therein, and provides additional insights, such as expected temperature mitigation effect induced by green roofs under climate change conditions, or the indoor temperature reduction targets that are needed for a particular city to have a maximum desired heatwave mitigation impact. However, the model parameters have to be carefully selected, after an accurate study of the domain literature. © 2020 The Author(s)',\n",
       " '“Nature based solutions” has been proposed at COP25 as an important venture for combating anthropogenic climate change, and soil biochar amendment have been proposed to have vast carbon sequestration potential. On the other hand, biochar carbon storage in soils is confronted with both biochar and soil carbon and nitrogen loss. The superposition of these two influences leads to complex variation in net greenhouse gas emissions from biochar-amended-soils. Nitrogen fertilization is a common agriculture practice in China and worldwide. To study the effects and mechanisms of biochar on soil net greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O) under different nitrogen fertilization gradient in a ferrallitic soil, a soil column experiment was conducted. Maize straw derived biochar (pyrolysed at 500 °C) and nitrogen fertilizer (ammonium sulfate) were investigated at varying application rates. It was found that biochar amendment increased CO2 emissions by 51.1%–57.1% and N2O emissions by 50.0%–73.7%, respectively, when soil was incubated with 50 mg N/kg nitrogen fertilization. The N2O emission in soil was dominated by nitrification, and the labile fraction of biochar played the dominant role in increasing soil CO2 and N2O emissions. Therefore, water or acid washing of biochar before its application would significantly reduce the net GHG emissions. When the nitrogen fertilization was applied at the unusually high level of 450 mg N/kg, the N2O emissions mainly came from denitrification. Biochar amendment introduced less soil CO2 emission increment, and suppressed N2O emissions by inhibition of denitrification via adsorption protection mechanism (towards nitrogen) and aeration effect. A chain mechanism has been illustrated and results from this study suggest that biochar is best applied to an environment or the circumstance that maximizes adsorption protection mechanism and aeration effect to achieve total greenhouse gas emission reduction. This study therefore provides basis for the scientific sound application and regulation of biochar amendment in soils. © 2020',\n",
       " 'Urban flooding is a major problem in many coastal cities around the world, mainly caused by factors such as poor urban planning, outdated sewer capacity or high frequent extreme events. In developing countries such as Ecuador, lack of monitoring, financial constraints and absence of proper policies exacerbate flooding problems. The use of the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) helped to identify zones that are flooded even with a 2-year precipitation event at Duran city. Since there are no flood monitoring stations across the study area, model calibration was performed against unofficial records (people complaints, media photographs, and water marks on walls). Model results fairly agreed with those unofficial record. However, a validation process is not achievable yet due to lack of enough flood data even in flood prone areas. To further increase city resilience, authorities and stakeholders should engage in climate actions to raise flood hazard-risk awareness, monitoring hydro-meteorological factors, complement drainage operations with nature-based solutions, and improve hydrodynamic modelling to develop a flood early warning system for the city. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'In a context of a rapidly changing livability of towns and countryside, climate change and biodiversity decrease, this paper introduces a landscape-based planning approach to regional spatial policy challenges allowing a regime shift towards a future land system resilient to external pressures. The concept of nature-based solutions and transition theory are combined in this approach, in which co-created normative future visions serve as boundary concepts. Rather than as an object in itself, the landscape is considered as a comprehensive principle, to which all spatial processes are inherently related. We illustrate this approach with three projects in the Netherlands in which landscape-based visions were used to guide the land transition, going beyond the traditional nature-based solutions. The projects studied show that a shared long-term future landscape vision is a powerful boundary concept and a crucial source of inspiration for a coherent design approach to solve today’s spatial planning problems. Further, they show that cherishing abiotic differences in the landscape enhances sustainable and resilient landscapes, that co-creation in the social network is a prerequisite for shared solutions, and that a landscape-based approach enhances future-proof land-use transitions to adaptive, circular, and biodiverse landscapes. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Air pollution affects many people in developed and developing countries worldwide. It is costing around 2% and 5% of GDP (gross domestic product) in developed and developing countries, respectively. The air qualities have been deteriorating day by day and now the situation has become worst. An increase in air pollution will worsen the environment and human health status. Hence, there is an urgent need for air pollution control. Air pollution can be controlled by reducing the emission of air pollutants from industrial and domestic sources through source emission control decrease in fuel combustion, modifying technology, and growing plants. This is the ripe time to take some bold steps in controlling the menace of air pollution. The scientific bodies, NGOs, researchers, and policymakers have made several efforts but pollution levels are increasing everywhere. The UNEP (The United Nations Environment Program), IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), etc., have prepared several reports and organize every year COPs (Conference of Parties) meeting but all have gone in vain as the main culprit feedback has not been taken into the consideration. So, a sincere effort is required to fight the effects of climate change. This paper presents a case study of the Agra region over the Indo-Gangetic basin. The air quality of different sites in Agra has been evaluated, and a survey has been conducted to get the public opinion on air pollution, causes, impacts, and solutions. 75% of respondents were aware of the poor air quality of Agra, however, the percentage of respondent who was unaware is not small. It is a matter of concern. 85% of respondents think that poor education and unawareness are the major cause of air pollution. They suggested education, value-based education to improve air quality. Based on these outcomes, it has been concluded that nature-based solutions for air pollution control can be achieved by making people environmentally conscious through value-based education. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',\n",

Picardo Farm is the oldest community garden in Seattle. Its success and popularity inspired the municipality of Seattle to develop a city-wide public program called the P-Patch Community Gardening program. We evaluated the perceptions of Picardo Farm gardeners about the benefits provided by the farm and the reasons why this community garden is so resilient. Gardeners were asked three open-ended questions and their responses were evaluated for recurring keywords regarding ecosystem services. We found that gardeners’ perceptions of ecosystem services vary, and they often underestimate ecosystem services related to regulation. We identified seven key topics from gardeners’ responses: a sense of community, placemaking, food, health, place attachment, nature, and education. Furthermore, our results indicate that, in order to achieve resilience, community gardens require public institutions to build and empower cohesive communities of gardeners and gardens need to be placed in urban areas suitable for agricultural use. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " \"Urbanization and extreme weather require smarter urban water management. Nature-based solutions (NBS) like vegetated roofs and city trees can contribute effectively to climate resilience and future proof urban water management. However, large scale implementation is limited due to a lack of knowledge among professionals on how to capture, store, and reuse water on-site. In this paper we advocate a classification into no-tech, low-tech, and high-tech green, thereby supporting urban designers to better utilize the ability of these green elements to effectively manage water flows in different urban settings. Here, “no tech” green is considered traditional urban green, handling (rain) water like nature would. “Low-tech” green (e.g., extensive Sedum roofs) are suitable for dense urban settings with limited demand for water management and ecosystem services. More developed “high-tech” green solutions have vegetation performing even beyond natural capacities, offering full water management control options and enable city planners, architects and landscape designers to enhance urban resilience and circularity without claiming valuable urban space. We elaborate our “tech NBS” approach for city trees and vegetated roofs thereby demonstrating the classification's added value for sustainable urban design. We conclude that specifying the demanded “no/low/high” -tech level of green infrastructure in urban design plans will help to yield the most of ecosystem services using appropriate levels of available technology. © Copyright © 2020 Snep, Voeten, Mol and Van Hattum.\",\n",

       " 'Climate change is a global phenomenon that poses local risks to sectors across society and the economy. All these growing risks have led the Municipality of San Donà di Piave—located within the Metropolitan City of Venice (CMVe)—to strengthen, over the years, its commitment to the adaptation to climate change in its plans and policies. Nature-based solutions can offer a perfect example of sustainable solutions to cope with climate change mitigation and adaptation challenges. In this context, thanks to the support of the LIFE Master Adapt project, San Donà di Piave, applying its methodologies and creating new territorial information, was able to insert, within its Action Plan for Sustainable Energy and Climate (SECAP), important and structural Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) for the entire municipal area. This experience demonstrates how this process of mainstreaming adaptation actions and NBSs is possible at all levels of government of the territory. It also highlights the virtuosity of replicability in other contexts of the CMVe and the transition from theoretical concepts to concrete actions (NBSs) for adaptation into existing plans.

       " 'Cities face unprecedented demographic, environmental, economic, social, and spatial challenges. In recent years, the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) is becoming more relevant in cities to improve urban resilience and to cope with climate change. NBS represent cost effective solutions that simultaneously provide environmental, social, and economic benefits and help build resilience. A comprehensive and multi-dimension Resilience Assessment Framework (RAF) to evaluate the NBS contribution to urban resilience, focused on NBS for stormwater management and control, was developed. This RAF is aligned with the RESCCUE RAF and the main assessment frameworks focused on NBS and urban resilience. This RAF for NBS is driven by the definition of resilience objectives and is able to evaluate short-and long-term changes, considering a comprehensive definition of the urban resilience and addressing the environmental, social, and economic capabilities. Regarding the initial resilience maturity and the available information in the city, three analysis degrees were proposed for the RAF application, namely, the essential, complementary, and comprehensive degrees, for which a pre-defined selection of metrics is proposed. This paper aims to present the application of the RAF essential analysis degree and its extensive validation regarding cities with different resilience maturity and available information. The application to seven cities with different resilience and NBS challenges allowed an in-depth validation of the pre-defined metrics included in the RAF essential analysis. In this sense, the analysis of the resilience maturity of the participating cities is presented, the main challenges and consolidated aspects in the cities are identified, and the cities ready to apply the complementary analysis degree are recognized. To conclude, to validate the essential analysis degree, the assessment of the main requirements of the RAF for NBS are verified, based on the RAF metrics results for the cities. In this light, the main requirements of the RAF for NBS were aggregated in three main categories, namely, NBS aspects, resilience capabilities, and the performance, risk and cost analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Mangrove-mud coasts across the world erode because of uninformed management, conversion of mangrove forests into aquaculture ponds, development of infrastructure and urbanization, and/or extraction of groundwater inducing land subsidence. The accompanied loss of ecosystem values, amongst which safety against flooding, has far reaching consequences for coastal communities, exacerbated by sea-level rise. To halt erosion various nature-based solutions have been implemented as an alternative to hard infrastructure sea defenses, including mangrove planting and erection of low-tech structures such as bamboo fences, permeable brushwood dams, etc. These structures have been designed on the basis of best-engineering practice, lacking sufficient scientific background. This paper investigates the use and success of permeable dams over a period of about 15 years, describing their application in Guyana, Indonesia, Suriname, Thailand and Vietnam, summarizing the lessons-learned, and analyzing their functioning in relation to the physical-biological coastal system. Also an overview of relevant costs is given. The basic philosophy behind the construction of permeable dams is the rehabilitation of mangrove habitat through re-establishment of the (fine) sediment dynamics – we refer to Building with Nature as the overarching principle of this approach. Our main conclusions are that a successful functioning of permeable dams requires (1) a thorough understanding of the physical-biological system and analysis of the relevant processes, (2) patience and persistence, including maintenance, as the natural time scales to rehabilitate mangrove green belts take years to decades, and (3) intensive stakeholder involvement. We give a list of conditions under which permeable dams may be successful, but in qualitative terms, as local site conditions largely govern their success or failure. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Present-day dense cities are increasingly affected by the impacts associated with climate change. The recurrence of extreme climate events is projected to be intensified in cities in the next decades, especially in the most vulnerable areas of the world, such as the Mediterranean region. In this context, the urban green infrastructure (UGI) is presented as a nature-based solution that directly contributes to climate change mitigation in Mediterranean compact cities and improves health, social, welfare, and environmental conditions for inhabitants. This research sets out a manageable framework to define, locate, and categorize more functional green urban and peri-urban areas in a dense Mediterranean city. It takes spatial distribution, extension, and the capacity to improve inhabitants’ wellbeing through the provision of ecosystem services as classification criteria. Results show a scenario with a greater functional green surface available for the citizens to be managed. Identified areas have been categorized as cores, nodes, links, and green spaces defined as “other” areas. In particular, the latter play a significant role at social, structural, and ecological levels. The study showcases that rethinking urban design and strategic decision-making around these areas can enhance green equity in Mediterranean dense cities, their capacity to better deal with environmental extremes, and the inhabitants’ engagement with a culture of sustainability and wellbeing. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'The aim of this study is to provide new knowledge on the effect of willow on hillslope hydrology at a slope scale. Soil moisture and matric suction were monitored in situ under willow-vegetated and fallow ground covers on a small-scale hillslope in Northeast Scotland for 21 months. The retrieved time series were analysed statistically to evaluate whether the dynamics of soil moisture and matric suction changed with the hillslope zone (i.e., toe, middle, and crest) under the two ground covers. The effect of air temperature and rainfall on the dynamics of soil moisture and matric suction, as well as the relationship between the two soil-water variables, under both ground covers, were also investigated by analysing the cross-correlation between time series. The results of 21 months of monitoring showed that willow contributed substantially to reduce soil moisture and to increase matric suction with respect to fallow soil. Additionally, willow-vegetated soil exhibited higher water retention and moisture buffering capacity than fallow soil. The effect of willow was highest at the hillslope toe due to a denser vegetation cover present within this zone. Both air temperature and rainfall had a strong effect on soil moisture and matric suction. However, the effect of air temperature was more consistent and easier to interpret than that of rainfall. Soil moisture and matric suction were shown to have a complex relationship and the soil water characteristic curve for vegetated soil requires further research. This study provides novel, field-based information supporting the positive effect of willow on hillslope hydrology. The results gathered herein will undoubtedly enhance the confidence of using woody vegetation in Nature-based Solutions (NBS) against geo-climatic hazards. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Despite the proliferation of control technologies, air pollution remains a major concern across the United States, suggesting the need for a paradigm shift in methods for mitigating emissions. Based on data about annual emissions in U.S. counties and current land cover, we show that existing forest, grassland, and shrubland vegetation take up a significant portion of current U.S. emissions. Restoring land cover, where possible, to county-level average canopy cover can further remove pollution of SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 by an average of 27% through interception of particulate matter and absorption of gaseous pollutants. We find such nature-based solutions to be cheaper than technology for several National Emission Inventory sectors. Our results with and without monetary valuation of ecological cobenefits identify sectors and counties that are most economically attractive for nature-based solutions as compared to the use of pollution control technologies. We also estimate the sizes of urban and rural populations that would benefit from this novel ecosystem-based approach. This suggests that even though vegetation cannot fully negate the impact of emissions at all times, policies encouraging ecosystems as control measures in addition to technological solutions may promote large investments in ecological restoration and provide several societal benefits.

       " 'For the restoration and maintenance of beach and dune systems along the coast, knowledge of aeolian sediment transport and its interaction with coastal protection measures is required. As a nature-based solution, sand trapping fences can be an integral part of coastal protection measures initiating foredune development. There are few detailed studies on aeolian sediment transport rates on coastal dunes and sand trapping fences available to date. Thus, in this work, we present the results of field experiments conducted at the beach, coastal dune, and sand trapping fence on the East Frisian island Langeoog. The vertical sediment flux profile was measured by vertical mesh sand traps, and saltiphones measured the instantaneous sediment transport. A meteorological station was set up to obtain wind data. On the beach, dune toe, and dune crest, the stationary wind profile can be described well by the law of the wall. Saturated aeolian sediment transport rates on the beach and dune toe were predicted by widely used empirical models. Between the sand trapping fence, these empirical transport models could not be applied, as no logarithmic wind profile existed. The upwind sediment supply reduced after each brushwood line of the sand trapping fence, thereby, leading to increased deviation from the saturated conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Worldwide, mountain forests represent a significant factor in reducing rockfall risk over long periods of time on large potential disposition areas. While the economic value of technical protection measures against rockfall can be clearly determined and their benefits indicated, there is no general consensus on the quantification of the protective effect of forests. Experience shows that wherever there is forest, the implementation of technical measures to reduce risk of rockfall might often be dispensable or cheaper, and large deforestations (e.g. after windthrows, forest fires, clear-cuts) often show an increased incidence of rockfall events. This study focussed on how the protective effect of a forest against rockfall can be quantified on an alpine transregional scale. We therefore estimated the runout length, in terms of the angle of reach, of 700 individual rockfall trajectories from 39 release areas from Austria, Germany, Italy and Slovenia. All recorded rockfall events passed through forests which were classified either as coppice forests or, according to the CORINE classification of land cover, as mixed, coniferous or broadleaved dominated high forest stands. For each individual rockfall trajectory, we measured the forest structural parameters stem number, basal area, top height, ratio of shrub to high forest and share of coniferous trees. To quantify the protective effect of forests on rockfall, a hazard reduction factor is introduced, defined as the ratio between an expected angle of reach without forest and the back-calculated forest-influenced angles of reach. The results show that forests significantly reduce the runout length of rockfall. The highest reduction was observed for mixed high forest stands, while the lowest hazard reduction was observed for high forest stands dominated either by coniferous or broadleaved tree species. This implies that as soon as one tree species dominates, the risk reduction factor becomes lower. Coppice forests showed the lowest variability in hazard reduction. Hazard reduction due to forests increases, on average, by 7% for an increase in the stem number by 100 stems per hectare. The proposed concept allows a global view of the effectiveness of protective forests against rockfall processes and thus enable to value forest ecosystem services for future transregional assessments on a European level. Based on our results, general cost–benefit considerations of nature-based solutions against rockfall, such as protective forests as well as first-order evaluations of rockfall hazard reduction effects of silvicultural measures within the different forest types, can be supported. © 2020, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'There is growing concern that the implementation of political agreements on climate change and biodiversity will not be enough to protect forests in the short run and up to the end of the 21st century. As mitigation efforts are lagging behind self-imposed, reasonable targets, genetic diversity will have a large and significant part to play in the process of adapting forests to climate change. Genetic diversity, the raw material of evolution, can be used for adaptation by natural selection and artificial breeding, in naturally regenerated and plantation forests alike. The 2-day scientific conference: “#rescueforests: Genetics to the rescue - Managing forests sustainably in a changing world,” addressed the genetic diversity of forests. More specifically, the conference was about natural as well as assisted adaptive processes, their spatial scale, from fine grain to landscape and ecoregions, and how much of the genome it involves. It also dealt with phenotypes and how much of their variation is determined by underlying genetic diversity. And finally, and perhaps most importantly, the conference emphasized the importance of conservation and sustainable use of this genetic diversity as a nature-based solution to adapt under the fast pace of climate change. The conference demonstrated how improved knowledge on genomic diversity and evolutionary mechanisms can help to rescue forests, either naturally or by means of management. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",

Specifically, we show i) results from a pilot plant with woodchip bioreactors for nitrate-enriched brine denitrification, and ii) the first results obtained in a pilot plant with bioreactors and constructed wetlands for treatment of agricultural drainage water and leachates, as well as other effluents. Nutrient discharges to the lagoon are highly variable and occur via drainage network, drains, stormwater pipes, direct groundwater discharges from the Quaternary aquifer, and others. For instance, between January 2017 and January 2018 measured daily superficial discharge (floods excluded) ofN-NO3− amounted from 119 kg d−1 to 1084 kg d−1. Estimations subsurface discharges ranged 815 to 3836 kg N-NO3− d−1 in 2018–2020. Field studies in coastal wetlands (e.g. inflow ≈20–30 mg N-NO3− L−1, removal ≈80–90%) and results from pilot plants with bioreactors (e.g. inflow ≈30–40 mg N-NO3− L−1, removal ≈90–95%) and constructed wetlands (e.g. inflow ≈30–40 mg N-NO3− L−1, removal ≈60–70%), showed the good performance of these systems for nutrient retention. Four strategies are considered for reducing nutrient inputs into the Mar Menor, which include a combination of nature-based solutions and best management practices. (i) Reducing the leaching of nitrate to the aquifer and export of nutrients and sediments following heavy rains by improving fertilization, and irrigation routines, and soil conservation measures in the agricultural fields. (ii) Development of effective and scalable tools for denitrification of nitrate-rich brine produced by on-farm desalination plants. (iii) Capture and treatment of polluted water discharged to the Mar Menor via hydrologic networks, subsurface flow, drainage ditches, and others. (iv) Preservation and restoration of coastal wetlands. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Interest and investment in constructing living shorelines rather than harder engineering structures are on the rise worldwide. However, the performance of these interventions in rejuvenating coastal habitats, depositing fine sediments with elevated organic content, and reducing erosion varies widely and is often low along energetic shorelines. In this study, we test the efficacy of a living shoreline design that couples breakwalls and oyster restoration structures, in protecting coastal estuarine ecosystems and their services along energetic shorelines. A field experiment was conducted between 2015 and 2019 along a section of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in northeast Florida, which experiences commercial and recreational vessel traffic. We discovered that organic matter, silt and clay content all increased in sediments collected in the living shorelines compared to paired control treatments. In addition, oysters established and developed into robust reefs on the gabions – wire cages filled with seasoned oyster shells - that were used to facilitate oyster recovery within this living shorelines design, although oyster growth was highest where the gabions were placed at lower intertidal elevations. Additionally, salt marsh cordgrass along shoreline margins protected by the living shoreline structures remained stable or began advancing toward the Intracoastal Waterway channel at rates of ~1 m per year, whereas cordgrass in control treatments retreated at rates approaching 2 m per year. This study provides powerful evidence that vessel wake stress is indeed driving ecosystem loss and that simple nature-based living shoreline structures designed to dissipate this energy can slow or reverse ecosystem decline. More research is needed to optimize these nature-based solutions for shoreline protection in coastal and estuarine settings, and to improve their durability. © 2020',\n",
       " \"Blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is becoming a more popular means of dealing with climate change and climate change-related events. However, as the concept of BGI is relatively new, many urban and rural planners are unfamiliar with the barriers they may face during the lifecycle of a BGI project. As a result, some have been hesitant to adopt BGI solutions. The literature has unveiled many of the barriers that inhibit the successful development of BGI, however, this information has yet to be presented in a manner that allows for easy identification. In this paper, a systematic literature review is undertaken to develop a framework which will enable BGI planners to assess the potential threats of a BGI project throughout the project's lifecycle. © 2020 The Authors\",\n",

Even in the context of nature-based climate solutions, which consider ecosystems to be crucial to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, the potential role of biodiversity has received little attention. Here this essay emphasizes biodiversity as the cause—not only the consequence—to help society and nature face challenges associated with the changing climate.

       " 'Rivers and floodplains are hotspots of biodiversity and provide an exceptional number of ecological functions. However, they are negatively affected by human impact worldwide. The need for restoration is high, but its realization is often hampered by antagonistic human interests. Replacing artificial riverbank protection with bioengineering techniques can be a first and straightforward step to restore riparian ecosystems. However, bioengineering still plays a marginal role in river management. We aim to introduce new arguments for bioengineering along riverbanks by applying the ecosystem service approach. We focus on major regulating services usually provided by floodplains. Denitrification and phosphorous retention were estimated by applying proxy-based models. Carbon sequestration within vegetation was calculated using biomass equations. Our study clearly indicates an increase of ecosystem services by bioengineering measures compared to conventionally fixed riverbanks. The dismantling of riprap removes up to 30 times more nitrogen and 20 times more phosphorous from the river load. Additional slope lowering increases both values up to 50-fold. The carbon storage capacity is four times higher in reed beds and 30 times higher in willow-brush mattresses. Our results show that bioengineering techniques for riverbank protection can be a feasible tool to support general efforts towards enhancing the self-purification of rivers and contribute to mitigating climate change, especially if conducted on a larger scale. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Background: The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) has evolved as an umbrella concept to describe approaches to learning from and using nature to create sustainable socio-ecological systems. Furthermore, NBS often address multiple societal challenges that humans are facing in the medium to long-term and as such can enhance human well-being (HWB). This study was commissioned to fulfil the need for a targeted systematic evidence map on the linkage between NBS and HWB to support focused research going forward that addresses the key knowledge needs of policy makers in the UK and beyond. Methods: A consultation with policy makers and government agency staff (n = 46), in the four component parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) was conducted in spring 2019. This identified four key societal challenges of operational experience lacking a scientific evidence base. Three of these challenges related to management issues: NBS cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice. The fourth challenge related to the acoustic environment (soundscape). Using systematic methods, this study searched for and identified studies that assessed NBS on HWB with regard to these four selected societal challenges. Review findings: A total of 7287 articles were returned from the systematic search and screened for suitability at the level of title and abstract. A total of 610 articles passed screening criteria to warrant full text screening. Of these, 115 studies met the full text criteria for eligibility in the final systematic map database. Included studies were coded for twelve NBS interventions and ten HWB related outcome categories. Most of the evidence reviewed referred to natural, blue or green infrastructure in the urban environment and focused on economic, material and health aspects of HWB. Less than 2% of studies identified in the searches robustly reported the role of NBS actions or interventions on HWB compared with non-NBS actions or interventions Conclusion: This systematic map found the evidence base is growing on NBS-HWB linkages, but significant biases persist in the existing literature. There was a bias in favour of the urban environment and restoration studies focused on conservation aspects, with only a few studies investigating the full suite of advantages to HWB that can be delivered from NBS actions and interventions. The soundscape was the least studied of the societal challenges identified as being of key importance by policy makers, with cost-efficiency the most reported. There was a lack of robust long-term studies to clearly test the potential of NBS regarding the HWB outcomes compared with non-NBS alternatives. This lack of robust primary knowledge, covering all four key societal challenges identified, confirms that the knowledge gaps identified by the policy makers persist, and highlights a clear research need for long-term, transdisciplinary studies that focus on comparisons between NBS and non-NBS alternatives. © 2020, The Author(s).',\n",
       " \"The necessity of incorporating a resilience-informed approach into urban planning and its decision-making is felt now more than any time previously, particularly in low and middle income countries. In order to achieve a successful transition to sustainable, resilient and cost-effective cities, there is a growing attention given to more effective integration of nature-based solutions, such as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), with other urban components. The experience of SuDS integration with urban planning, in developed cities, has proven to be an effective strategy with a wide range of advantages and lower costs. The effective design and implementation of SuDS requires a multi-objective approach by which all four pillars of SuDS design (i.e., water quality, water quantity, amenity and biodiversity) are considered in connection to other urban, social, and economic aspects and constraints. This study develops a resilience-driven multi-objective optimisation model aiming to provide a Pareto-front of optimised solutions for effective incorporation of SuDS into (peri)urban planning, applied to a case study in Brazil. This model adopts the SuDS's two pillars of water quality and water quantity as the optimisation objectives with its level of spatial distribution as decision variables. Also, an improved quality of life index (iQoL) is developed to re-evaluate the optimal engineering solutions to encompass the amenity and biodiversity pillars of SuDS. Rain barrels, green roofs, bio-retention tanks, vegetation grass swales and permeable pavements are the suitable SuDS options identified in this study. The findings show that the most resilient solutions are costly but this does not guarantee higher iQoL values. Bio-retention tanks and grass swales play effective roles in promotion of water quality resilience but this comes with considerable increase in costs. Permeable pavements and green roofs are effective strategies when flood resilience is a priority. Rain barrel is a preferred solution due to the dominance of residential areas in the study area and the lower cost of this option. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions have recently been embraced as one route towards simultaneously addressing urban environmental and social problems, but an emerging agenda has sought to ask whether and how the ‘greening’ of cities may actually reinforce inequalities or lead to new forms of social exclusion. Using comparative case-study analysis, this paper examines the extent to which nature-driven stewardship initiatives recognize and redress inequalities. We compare two urban contexts that have undergone significant societal transformations over the last two to three decades: Sofia and Cape Town. The comparison shows how nature-driven stewardship initiatives differentially address deeper roots of environmental, social and racial privilege shaped significantly by post-socialist and post-apartheid transition contexts. Instead of assuming a homogenous ideal of urban nature and focusing on questions of the distribution of urban nature and its access, this paper finds it is important to consider the kinds of social relations that are required to both shape decision-making processes and generate meaningful and diverse values and ways of relating to nature in the city. Furthermore, it finds that inclusive nature-based solution governance recognizes and redresses both inequalities in access and inequalities that perpetuate dominant views about what nature is and for whom nature is produced and maintained. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Many cities are facing various environmental problems, where performance-based planning and nature-based solutions have been proposed to address such problems. As a natural landscape in the city, urban waterfront space has efficient ecological benefits, high-quality landscape vision and environment, and it is an important carrier of citizens’ activities. However, existing studies have mainly focused on coping with environmental problems, while social functions and strategies have been neglected. Therefore, this study aims to fill such research gaps by understanding the social performance of urban waterfront spaces. Field observation and questionnaire survey were conducted in a famous urban waterfront space, Qiantang riverside walkway, in Hangzhou, China. The results indicate that the Qiantang riverside walkway serves as a space for tourism, leisure and entertainment, as the visitors who lived more than 5 km away from here accounted for about 50% and the local people also accounted for about 50%. People’s activities exhibited significantly temporal differences, where the occupation of the Qiantang riverside walkway reached a peak at night. For the people who lived far from here, they mainly depended on self-driving, which led to two critical problems relevant to transport linkage with the city and parking lot. Results also indicate that the landscape, supporting facilities and road functions could perform well among the mind of 102 respondents. However, public service and main facilities should be improved to meet more people’s requirements. Moreover, importantly, the results indicate the phenomenon of stratification and agglomeration so that the similar aspects (e.g. rest seat quantity, rest seat style) could be merged into the same cluster (e.g. rest seat) for consideration in the urban waterfront space planning and design. This study also generates some implications for the renovation of urban waterfront spaces. Overall, this study provides people with basic understanding of the social performance of existing urban waterfront spaces, which can further promote urban planners and designers to comprehensively build sustainable, resilient and healthy water-based living environments. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'The idea of nature having multiple benefits for urban management and planning is gaining prominence alongside the rise of climate change awareness. It is expressed through concepts such as nature-based solutions (NbS), ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), and blue-green infrastructure (BGI). Despite their popularity in the international arena, relatively little is known about how these concepts are used and interpreted at the local level, which has implications for policy formulation and actions. This paper examined both direct and indirect references to these concepts, as well as the reasons for their potential omission. By analysing policy documents and interviews with practitioners and activists from four Polish cities (Gdansk, Krakow, Warsaw, Wroclaw), it discussed the uneven and ambivalent uptake of concepts in the urban green and blue space (UGBS) governance. While the reluctance to use new terminology was often explained by accessibility and efficiency concerns, it also revealed some conceptual confusion. The contribution of this study is twofold: 1) providing a more nuanced understanding of the conceptual ambiguity surrounding the NbS, EbA and BGI concepts and the gap between international policy rhetorics and local interpretation; 2) expanding the geography of research on urban climate adaptation and urban green spaces which tends to overlook the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'Background: The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) has evolved as an umbrella concept embracing concepts such as Green/Blue/Nature Infrastructure, Ecosystem Approach, Ecosystem Services, but at their core, they cluster into the general theme of learning from and using nature to create sustainable socio-ecological systems, which enhance human well-being (HWB). NBS address societal challenges across a broad range of spatial scales - local, regional and global - and temporal scales - medium to long-term. While there are many reviews and a clear evidence base linking certain NBS to various elements of HWB, particularly urban greenspace and human health, no comprehensive mapping exists of the links between NBS interventions and the associated multiple positive and negative HWB outcomes across a range of habitats. The initial research phase used a participatory co-design process to select four priority societal challenges facing the United Kingdom: three related to management issues i.e. NBS cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice, and the fourth threats to the acoustic environment. These challenges collectively address priority management issues which stakeholders requested be investigated widely i.e. across landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes and soundscapes. Results of the study are intended to identify and define potential future environmental evidence challenges for UK science. Methods: This protocol describes the methodology for approaching the research question: What evidence is there for nature based solutions and their impacts on human wellbeing for societal challenges related to cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice, and the acoustic environment? Using systematic mapping, this study will search for and identify studies that seek to assess nature-based solutions on human well-being with regard to these four societal challenges. Systematic searches across a number of academic/online databases are tested against a number of test articles. Search results are refined using eligibility criteria through a three stage process: title, abstract, full text. Data from screened studies are extracted using a predefined coding strategy. Key trends in data will be synthesized according to a range of secondary questions and be presented in a graphical matrix illustrating the knowledge gaps and clusters for research into nature-based solutions and human well-being for each societal challenge. © 2019 The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Responsiveness and resilience to coastal disasters is an increasingly critical need for governments, businesses, and communities as the intensity of hurricanes, coastal storms and sea level rise exacerbates flood and erosion damages. The number and severity of disasters have increased significantly over the past two decades while intense coastal development has steadily degraded the protective and other ecosystem benefits from natural habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses. Such ecosystems can provide cost-effective, long-term risk reduction and other benefits to coastal communities. Yet easy, low-cost methodologies for incorporating such natural capital values into metrics that can inform policy and investment decisions have been lacking until recently. Whereas new approaches and studies have developed ways to quantify and assess such risk reduction benefits, finding the data to assess such services in data poor environments, both for regional and local scales, remains challenging. This paper outlines how breakthroughs in data technologies can help with incorporating ecosystem benefits into real-world policy and investment applications. Specific new data and analytical technologies are increasingly being used to quantify coastal risk reduction and other ecosystem benefits. We review several case studies where ecosystem benefits were quantified based on new data technologies and used for policy and investment strategies to improve a broader suite of ecosystem benefits to coastal communities. Equipping public and private sector actors with cost-effective and accessible approaches and tools to incorporate nature-based solutions into disaster risk management and coastal zone management planning more generally can transform climate resilience strategies around the world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Vegetated roofs are hoped to benefit urban wildlife, yet there are few empirical results regarding the conservation potential of such roofs. In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation. © 2020, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'There is increased interest in the potential of tree planting to help mitigate flooding using nature-based solutions or natural flood management. However, many publications based upon catchment studies conclude that, as flood magnitude increases, benefit from forest cover declines and is insignificant for extreme flood events. These conclusions conflict with estimates of evaporation loss from forest plot observations of gross rainfall, through fall and stem flow. This study explores data from existing studies to assess the magnitudes of evaporation and attempts to identify the meteorological conditions under which they would be supported. This is achieved using rainfall event data collated from publications and data archives from studies undertaken in temperate environments around the world. The meteorological conditions required to drive the observed evaporation losses are explored theoretically using the Penman–Monteith equation. The results of this theoretical analysis are compared with the prevailing meteorological conditions during large and extreme rainfall events in mountainous regions of the United Kingdom to assess the likely significance of wet canopy evaporation loss. The collated dataset showed that event Ewc losses between approximately 2 and 38% of gross rainfall (1.5 to 39.4 mm day−1) have been observed during large rainfall events (up to 118 mm day−1) and that there are few data for extreme events (&gt;150 mm day−1). Event data greater than 150 mm (reported separately) included similarly high percentage evaporation losses. Theoretical estimates of wet-canopy evaporation indicated that, to reproduce the losses towards the high end of these observations, relative humidity and the aerodynamic resistance for vapour transport needed to be lower than approximately 97.5% and 0.5 to 2 s m−1 respectively. Surface meteorological data during large and extreme rainfall events in the United Kingdom suggest that conditions favourable for high wet-canopy evaporation are not uncommon and indicate that significant evaporation losses during large and extreme events are possible but not for all events and not at all locations. Thus the disparity with the results from catchment studies remains. © 2020 The Authors. Hydrological Processes published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd',\n",
       " 'Effectively implementing landscape-scale forest restoration on the ground is particularly challenging. Available decision-support tools particularly lack the ability to comprehensively incorporate biophysical, social and institutional dimensions in a spatially explicit manner from the pixel to the whole landscape. In order to contribute to fulfilling this gap, this paper has two major objectives. The first is to present a spatially explicit decision-support tool for mapping Forest Restoration Vocation (FRV) that includes socio-economic and institutional aspects in forest landscape restoration. The second is to discuss the ways in which the FRV has been applied in the Brazilian decision-making context. The FRV was used to prioritize areas for three different restoration modalities: assisted natural regeneration (passive restoration), forest plantation with native trees to conserve biodiversity and forest plantation for agroforestry systems (active restoration). The FRV is already being adopted as a planning tool to invest R$ 1.2 billion (approx. US$ 300 million) to restore 40,000 ha in the Rio Doce, Brazil—an area corresponding to 0.05% of the area of watershed. Due to the high level of degradation of the basin, there is a need to restore 1.6 Mha via forest plantations in riparian Areas of Permanent Preservation (APPs) while 30% of APPs can be effectively restored using natural regeneration. The FRV can be effective for gauging progress and monitoring forest restoration implementation metrics across the landscape and through time. There are however still problems in effectively assessing if the investment in forest restoration will generate impact in the long term and deliver the ecosystem services society depends on. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Nowadays, the use of constructed wetlands for on-site greywater treatment is a very promising option. The successful application of this nature-based solution at full scale requires public acceptance, economic feasibility and the production of high-quality treated greywater. This work focuses on the use of ornamental plants as vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) vegetation for greywater treatment, aiming to improve aesthetic and acceptability of the system. The performance and economic feasibility of the proposed green technology were examined during a 2-years study. Results show that Pittosporum tobira and Hedera helix can grow in VFCW operating with greywater without any visible symptoms. These species tolerated both drought and flooding conditions, making them ideal for use not only in residential buildings but also in seasonal hotels and holiday homes. In contrast, partial defoliation of Polygala myrtifolia plants was observed during the winter period. High average removal efficiencies were observed for BOD (99%), COD (96%) and TSS (94%) in all examined VFCWs including unplanted beds. Phosphorus removal gradually decreased from 100% during first months of operation to 15% during second year of operation. In addition, total coliforms concentration reduced by 2.2 log units in the effluent of all planted systems, while lower removal efficiency was observed in the absence of plants. The mean concentration of BOD and TSS in the treated greywater met the standards for indoor reuse (<10 mg/L). Cost payback periods for the installation of the proposed technology in a multi-family building, a single house and a hotel in Greece were found 4.7, 16.6 and 2.5 years, respectively. Overall, the “treatment gardens” proposed in this study provide a technically and economically feasible solution for greywater treatment, with the additional benefit of improving the aesthetic of urban, semi-urban and touristic areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Water quality is critical for fish health in aquaculture production. In flow-through systems, the inflowing water normally requires quality controls and treatments for being supplied from coastal water bodies that can be polluted by nutrients, suspended solids, and microorganisms. Here we assess how seagrass meadows benefit aquaculture systems through the provision of ecosystem services (water filtration, biological control, and regulation of dissolved gasses) in the water reservoir that supplies earthen ponds in an aquaculture system in southern Portugal. In the 1.45-ha reservoir, seagrasses retained daily an estimate of 0.8–1.8 kg d−1 of nitrogen, 0.04–0.07 kg d−1 of phosphorus in their biomass, and 0.7–1.1 kg dw d−1 of suspended total particulate matter, bringing benefits in terms of nutrient and particle removal from the water column. Diel and spatial variation in faecal coliforms levels (Escherichia coli) in the reservoir suggested that seagrasses, in combination with light exposure, may reduce the levels of this pathogen. Furthermore, the seagrass-dominated system oxygenated the water through photosynthesis at a faster rate than the respiratory oxygen consumption, maintaining the system above the aquaculture minimum oxygen. This study demonstrates that seagrasses can be used as a nature-based solution to overcome water quality challenges in flow-through aquaculture ponds. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'The increase in urbanization has caused a deterioration of the quality of water bodies and ecosystems such as rivers, streams and lakes. Urban hydrology, which reflects the anthropogenic impact on water balance, results in an excess of phosphorus (P) and their eutrophication in urban water bod-ies. Nature-based solutions (NBS) are a measure for the restorations of green areas and the mitiga-tion of urban stormwater problems. Despite many advantages, in some specific cases (e.g., green roofs), NBS may be a source of water pollution. The way to decrease P release from NBS construction is by using P-binding mineral materials (P-BMM). The aim of the study is: (1) to assess the sorption abilities of five different P-BMMs: autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), Filtralite® Nature P (FNP) (Norway), limestone, Opoka and zeolite, (2) to determinate of the equilibrium contact time with P solution, and (3) to dimension the P-BMM filter mass needed to enhance P-removal from green roof run-off before it reaches the receiver. Based on the Langmuir isotherm equation, P-BMM maximum sorption capacity (Smax) and equilibrium sorption capacity (Smax_Eq) follow the sequence: FNP &gt; Opoka &gt; AAC &gt; zeolite &gt; limestone. The most suitable P-BMM for filling up the filter for green roof runoff seems to be AAC. This is because it took the shortest time to achieve equilibrium (300 min) and had high Smax_Eq value (66.28 mg g–1). The mass of AAC P-BMM needed to pro-vide the P retention from 100 m2 of a green roof ranges from 2.4 to 11.2 kg. The P-BMM filter, with a discharge to rain garden, was proposed as a P-removal enhancing system for green roof runoff. © 2020 Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.',\n",

To our knowledge, the present work is the first to scientifically document the in-situ establishment of an FWI in a seawater port marina. The establishment and performance of a cork floating platform with a polyculture (Sarcocornia perennis, Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Halimione portulacoides, Spartina maritima, Limonium vulgare) was evaluated. The diversity of organisms present in the FWI was undertaken based on the macrofauna assessment, taking into consideration marine water characterization, with a focus on hydrocarbons. Microbial communities were assessed based on metabarcoding approach to study 16S rRNA gene from environmental DNA retrieved from biofilm (from the planting media), marine biofouling (from the submerged platform) and surface marina water. S. perennis was the species with the highest survival rate and growth. The structure of the microbial community showed clear differences between those established in the FWI and those in the surrounding water, showing the presence of some bacterial groups that can be relevant for bioremediation processes (e.g., Saprospiraceae family). Concerning the macrofauna analysis, Mytilus sp. was the predominant taxa. To be of relevance, total petroleum hydrocarbons were detected at the marina up to ca. 6 mg/L. This study gives new insights into broadening FWI application to the saline environments of port marinas and to supporting a management strategy to promote several ecosystem services such biodiversity, species habitat, water quality enhancement and added aesthetic value to the marina landscape. © 2020 by the authors.

The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis also coincides with a critical opportunity to fight against ecosystem degradation and climate change. In this opinion article, I put in perspective that by investing in ecological restoration, governments do not have to choose between economic priorities and environmental concerns. First, I describe the restoration economy and give real-world examples of how investing in restoration activities can simultaneously ease pressure on the environment and create immediate jobs and revenues. Then I suggest that to obtain political attraction, a successful restoration strategy will require a triple-bottom-line approach to ensure that in addition to environmental objectives, stakeholders integrate socioeconomic outcomes in decision-making. Finally, I conclude that a new economic approach that prioritizes investment in our ecological capital will necessitate transdisciplinary policies to build bridges across the different silos of the economy and the environment. © 2020 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Restoration Ecology © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration Reproduced with the permission of the Minister of Natural Resources Canada',\n",
       " 'One significant concern of Ontario’s water quality management is the reduction in nutrient export. Decision makers have considered nature-based solutions, such as wetlands, depending on their cost-effectiveness for nutrient filtering. All wetland ecosystems interact with the surrounding environment; however, their performances are not always known, which prevents a fair comparison with other treatment alternatives. This study presents a methodological approach for mapping areas that can potentially support effective (or ineffective) wetlands for nutrient buffering. The Grand River watershed, Ontario was selected to demonstrate the methodology. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are combined with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to evaluate wetland effectiveness under geomorphological, climatological, hydrological, and land use factors. The selected factor maps (criteria) are normalized, and then used as inputs in an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted by experts based on how these factors affect wetlands’ performance. The promising areas’ spatial distributions are the output, which is compared with previous studies’ mappings of nutrient concentrations in the watershed. The proposed tool provides a low-cost preliminary estimation that informs policymakers if wetland solutions could achieve the desired environmental goals. This methodological approach supports Canadian wetland conservation efforts and enables a more complete decision-making process. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Arsenic found in agriculture water reservoirs represents a threat to water security and safe agricultural products in developing countries. Small farms do not implement traditional water treatments due to the high cost; hence, a nature-based solution is an alternative to tackling this challenge. This paper investigated the potential of artificial floating island with Vetiver (AFIV) for the geogenic arsenic removal present in the reservoir of the Ilinizas páramo in Ecuador. We constructed two AFIV systems using PVC pipes in a reservoir batch type with a 3.6 m3 treatment capacity. Arsenic and iron were analyzed in duplicated every 30 days at the affluent and effluent through 120 days. The average remediation of arsenic was recorded as 97% in water and 84% in sediment, while the average remediation of iron was 87% in sediment. The survival rate of macrophytes was 92%; they accumulated arsenic in its roots that acted as a barrier against the translocation. The research demonstrated that the use of AFIV has the potential to rehabilitate reservoirs contaminated with arsenic under adverse climatic conditions such as the páramo ecosystem. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Trees in urban settings are becoming increasingly important as mediators to emerging challenges that transect social, environmental, and economic factors. Trees provide shade; absorb and store atmospheric carbon and other pollutants; reduce local temperature fluctuations; provide essential inner-city fauna habitat; assist in reducing over-land stormwater flow; provide amenity; and provide many more social, environmental, and economic benefits. To secure these benefits, tree canopy cover targets are commonly employed by land managers; however, such targets are rarely quantified against the characteristics and limitations of individual urban centers. Through the generation and interrogation of qualitative and quantitative data, this case study of Perth, Western Australia presents a new conceptual tool that integrates eleven factors found to influence the capacity and opportunity for a city to support urban tree canopy cover. This tool is designed to capture and causally weigh urban tree canopy considerations based on individual city characteristics, collective values, and identifiable constraints. The output of the tool provides an “optimum” tree canopy cover result (as a percentage of the urban fabric) to better inform canopy cover targets and recommendations for urban tree strategic planning and management. This tool is valuable for urban land managers, city planners, urban designers, and communities in effective planning, management, valuation, and investment regarding urban trees as a sub-set of urban green infrastructure. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in high-level, decision-making arenas as a response to global policy challenges. Claiming to be transformative and pluralistic, NbS aim to resolve societal problems through a focus on nature, which is understood to be a benign ally. This uncritical framing of nature may have unintended and inequitable consequences that undermine the emancipatory potential of NbS. In this paper, we highlight the need to pay attention to epistemic and power dimensions that tend to be hidden in NbS. We assume that nature is neither passive nor external to human society, but is instead expressed in frames (reifying modes of expression) that reflect both knowledge and power in social encounters where NbS are used. Drawing upon five cases, we analyse how particular ways of framing nature express and reinforce the power relations that structure people's interactions. Each of the five cases relies on a nature-based frame to produce knowledge on climate adaptation, peacebuilding and justice. The analysis reveals how frames of nature are enacted in particular contexts, and how this conditions the potential for societal transformation towards sustainability and pluralistic knowledge. We demonstrate how frames of nature can constrain or enable opportunities for various groups to respond to environmental change. We discuss how the NbS paradigm might better incorporate diverse, situated knowledge and subjectivities, and conclude that this will require a more critical evaluation of NbS practice and research. © 2020 The Authors\",\n",
       " \"Cities are wrestling with the practical challenges of transitioning urban water services to become water sensitive; capable of enhancing liveability, sustainability, resilience and productivity in the face of climate change, rapid urbanisation, degraded ecosystems and ageing infrastructure. Indicators can be valuable for guiding actions for improvement, but there is not yet an established index that measures the full suite of attributes that constitute water sensitive performance. This paper therefore presents the Water Sensitive Cities (WSC) Index, a new benchmarking and diagnostic tool to assess the water sensitivity of a municipal or metropolitan city, set aspirational targets and inform management responses to improve water sensitive practices. Its 34 indicators are organised into seven goals: ensure good water sensitive governance, increase community capital, achieve equity of essential services, improve productivity and resource efficiency, improve ecological health, ensure quality urban spaces, and promote adaptive infrastructure. The WSC Index design is a quantitative framework based on qualitative rating descriptions and a participatory assessment methodology, enabling local contextual interpretations of the indicators while maintaining a robust universal framework for city comparison and benchmarking. The paper demonstrates its application on three illustrative cases. Rapid uptake of the WSC Index in Australia highlights its value in helping stakeholders develop collective commitment and evidence-based priorities for action to accelerate their city's water sensitive transition. Early testing in cities in Asia, the Pacific and South Africa has also showed the potential of the WSC Index internationally. © 2020\",\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NbS) to climate change currently have considerable political traction. However, national intentions to deploy NbS have yet to be fully translated into evidence-based targets and action on the ground. To enable NbS policy and practice to be better informed by science, we produced the first global systematic map of evidence on the effectiveness of nature-based interventions for addressing the impacts of climate change and hydrometeorological hazards on people. Most of the interventions in natural or semi-natural ecosystems were reported to have ameliorated adverse climate impacts. Conversely, interventions involving created ecosystems (e.g., afforestation) were associated with trade-offs; such studies primarily reported reduced soil erosion or increased vegetation cover but lower water availability, although this evidence was geographically restricted. Overall, studies reported more synergies than trade-offs between reduced climate impacts and broader ecological, social, and climate change mitigation outcomes. In addition, nature-based interventions were most often shown to be as effective or more so than alternative interventions for addressing climate impacts. However, there were substantial gaps in the evidence base. Notably, there were few studies of the cost-effectiveness of interventions compared to alternatives and few integrated assessments considering broader social and ecological outcomes. There was also a bias in evidence toward the Global North, despite communities in the Global South being generally more vulnerable to climate impacts. To build resilience to climate change worldwide, it is imperative that we protect and harness the benefits that nature can provide, which can only be done effectively if informed by a strengthened evidence base. © 2020 The Authors.

       " 'The rise in urban air temperature has forced the researchers to look for nature-based solutions to resolve the problem sustainably. Urban waterbody plays a multidimensional role in the well-being of the city by catering to its economical, ecological, and socio-cultural needs. It can offer a potential solution for urban heat attenuation, but its effect on outdoor thermal comfort is contentious in humid subtropical climate. This study investigates the thermal impact of waterbody on its surroundings in humid subtropical climate by adopting a human centric approach. Waterbody impact on ambient air temperature, PET, and UTCI are evaluated and compared for a better understanding of its thermal impact on nearby surroundings. This study employs a CFD-based simulation model Envi-met for microclimate analysis. The results show that a dynamic waterbody lowers the ambient air temperature during daytime in summer of its nearby surroundings in humid subtropical climate. Maximum cooling is observed in open mid-rise LCZ where the cooling impact range is 140\\xa0m with the amplitude of 2.59\\xa0°C and compact low-rise LCZ exhibits minimum cooling of the identified LCZs with the cooling impact ending 24\\xa0m from waterbody edge with amplitude being 0.131\\xa0°C in the study area. Air temperature, UTCI, and PET do reflect the same trend when moving away from the waterbody in large low-rise LCZ, but it decreases drastically in open mid-rise LCZ and is non-existent in compact low-rise. This result provides an insight on the impact of waterbody on thermal comfort in its surroundings in humid subtropical climate, thus assisting urban planners and designers in making context-specific holistic decision. © 2020, ISB.',\n",
       " \"Nature-based solutions (NBS) are heralded as tools to address and tackle a variety of socio-ecological challenges. NBS are increasingly discussed as a response to shocks and stresses such as loss of biodiversity, air pollution, heat waves, flooding, droughts; and issues around residents' health and wellbeing. In recognition of these multiple functions and potential co-benefits, cities are increasingly developing NBS strategies through urban forests, green walls and facades. There has recently been a vibrant debate about extending, linking or merging successful NBS - often framed as 'scaling-up'. Despite the increasing popularity, little is known about the mechanisms and conditions for scaling-up of NBS and how this plays out in practice. How is scaling-up understood and is there an optimal scale for NBS? Previous work has addressed that the misinterpretation of scale can produce suboptimal outcomes for the resilience and sustainability of human-environmental systems. Particularly challenging is the introduction of new and adjusting established institutional arrangements to drive and coordinate socio-ecological change. Using the strategy 'Living Melbourne – Our metropolitan urban forest' as a case study, this paper explores and analyses how NBS and scaling-up are addressed and implemented in a metropolitan-wide greening strategy. The study shows that scaling-up of NBS is complex and needs inter- and transdisciplinary expertise to cope with a range of ecological, institutional and socio-cultural challenges. Intermediaries are needed to provide platforms of ongoing exchange between the heterogenous stakeholders from public and private sectors, academia and society. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'The Mediterranean region has been identified as one of the most affected global hot-spots for climate change, which is already manifested by faster increasing temperatures than the global mean and significant decreases in annual precipitation. Besides, over the past decades, important land cover changes have occurred, such as reforestation, agricultural intensification, urban expansion and the construction of many reservoirs. Here we study the impacts of these changes in a typical large Mediterranean catchment and focus on relevant ecosystem services, i.e. primary production, water supply, food production, water regulation, flood and erosion control, and cultural ecosystem services. We applied a hydrological model, coupled with a soil erosion and sediment transport model, for the period 1971–2010 to the entire catchment, and for an extended period (1952–2018), with more pronounced land use changes, to one of its subcatchments that plays a crucial role for regional drinking water provision. Climate change in the evaluated period is characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature. Land use changes included an increase in natural vegetation in the headwaters, agricultural intensification and reservoir construction in the central part, and urban expansion in the downstream part of the catchment. The positive impacts on ecosystem services were quantified by a decrease in hillslope erosion, sediment yield, sediment concentration and flood discharge, which are mainly attributed to climate change and reservoir construction. The negative impacts were quantified by an increase in plant water stress and a decrease in reservoir storage, for which the latter is mainly attributed to reforestation in the headwater catchments. While grey infrastructures like reservoir construction showed important positive impacts on some ecosystem services, such as water regulation and flood control, they also potentially induce negative impacts, such as an increase of water demand and ecological integrity. We argue that a shift is needed to green infrastructures and nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and sustainable land management, which may lead to similar benefits on ecosystem services, but without the negative impacts caused by grey infrastructures. This supports the need for integrated land-use management to sustainably protect ecosystem services, considering the expected climate change impacts on Mediterranean environments and societies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'In addition to flooding and water quality management, blue-green infrastructure (BGI) provides multiple benefits to humans and ecosystems, including health and biodiversity. Various tools are available for assessing these benefits but few evaluate economic benefits. Two tools that monetize the benefits, the Benefits Estimation Tool (B£ST) (UK) and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) (Netherlands), have been used to estimate value for a case study in Luleå, Sweden. Three options for a newly developed area were assessed in comparison with two different baselines. The main economic benefits of the newly developed area were related to amenities, home values, health, and social cohesion rather than to stormwater. However, as a result of the proposed development, negative economic benefits (i.e., costs) were attributed to carbon sequestration and biodiversity when considering the value of the existing area due to a loss of green spaces and trees. B£ST gave higher negative impacts than TEEB. Direct comparison of each category used in each tool was not possible since these categories and the way in which the monetized values are determined in each case differ. While the overall approach used in both tools is applicable in Sweden, calculations and data used need to be adapted to local circumstances and valuation. © 2020 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.',\n",
       " \"The potential to capture additional air pollutants by introducing more vegetation or changing existing short vegetation to woodland on first sight provides an attractive route for lowering urban pollution. Here, an atmospheric chemistry and transport model was run with a range of landcover scenarios to quantify pollutant removal by the existing total UK vegetation as well as the UK urban vegetation and to quantify the effect of large-scale urban tree planting on urban air pollution. UK vegetation as a whole reduces area (population)-weighted concentrations significantly, by 10% (9%) for PM 2.5, 30% (22%) for SO 2, 24% (19%) for NH 3 and 15% (13%) for O 3, compared with a desert scenario. By contrast, urban vegetation reduces average urban PM 2.5 by only approximately 1%. Even large-scale conversion of half of existing open urban greenspace to forest would lower urban PM 2.5 by only another 1%, suggesting that the effect on air quality needs to be considered in the context of the wider benefits of urban tree planting, e.g. on physical and mental health. The net benefits of UK vegetation for NO 2 are small, and urban tree planting is even forecast to increase urban NO 2 and NOx concentrations, due to the chemical interaction with changes in BVOC emissions and O 3, but the details depend on tree species selection. By extrapolation, green infrastructure projects focusing on non-greenspace (roadside trees, green walls, roof-top gardens) would have to be implemented at very large scales to match this effect. Downscaling of the results to micro-interventions solely aimed at pollutant removal suggests that their impact is too limited for their cost-benefit analysis to compare favourably with emission abatement measures. Urban vegetation planting is less effective for lowering pollution than measures to reduce emissions at source. The results highlight interactions that cannot be captured if benefits are quantified via deposition models using prescribed concentrations, and emission damage costs.

       " \"The calibrated foredunes of the Aquitaine coast (SW France) constitute an example of secular extensive application of nature-based solution. Being one of the longest and largest dune systems in Europe, this iconic landscape offers considerable services to coastal societies. Since the mid-half of the 18th century, human work on sediment flows has resulted in the emergence of large sets of foredunes, currently constituting an almost 230 km-long managed barrier against inland sand invasion, coastline erosion, coastal flooding and also a major reserve of biodiversity. Last massive mechanic shaping of the foredunes following a so-called “ideal profile” date back to the 1970s–80s and aimed to limit erosion dynamics and sediment mobility. Since, they have been facing multiples disruptions over the years which have considerably modified their morphology, especially during the last decades. Calibrated foredunes are currently exhibiting impressive dimensions with a mean dune height of about 16.6 m (peaking at &gt;30 m in some locations) and a dune width mean along the coast of 187 m. Today, 55.5% of them meet the “ideal profile” shape standards or surpass the in terms of dimensions whereas 21,5% of the calibrated foredunes are considered “narrowed” and need specific attention. This regional analysis, based on extensive airborne LiDAR datasets from 2011 to 2018, includes (i) a dune morphology classification based on several basic geomorphological indicators (dune width, height, crest position, back dune elevation) compared to a calibrated “idealised” shaped profile, (ii) a quantification of marine beach-dune and aeolian sediments flows (in m/year and m/m2/year) and forms on dunes (scarps, blowouts, depositional lobes), as an indicator of the recent dynamics affecting dune morphology and (iii) a study of management control of calibrated foredunes (4613 interventions) including actions taken after the outstanding winter of 2013–2014. As expected, intensive dune management are mainly focused where assets are directly threatened. The study highlights the importance and the efficiency of human management on dune evolutions (long term dune form stability, control of gullies and incipient frontal blowout after marine erosion, protection of human issues). However, today management actions (wind fence, branch cover, planting and reshaping) are not conditioned by foredune morphology or last decade's beach-dune dynamic (sediment availability, chronic coastline erosion). Considering long-term erosion projections and expected impact of climate change, the analysis shows the need of more global and extensive strategies in order to preserve the protection role of foredunes in the coming decades. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'Effective adaptation to sea-level rise is critical for future flood protection. Nature-based solutions including salt marshes have been proposed to naturally enhance coastal infrastructure. A gently sloping grass-covered dike (i.e. Wide Green Dike) can be strengthened with clay accumulating locally in the salt marsh. This study explores the feasibility of extracting salt-marsh sediment for dike reinforcement as a climate adaptation strategy in several sea-level rise scenarios, using the Wide Green Dike in the Dutch part of the Ems-Dollard estuary as a case study. A 0-D sedimentation model was combined with a wave propagation model, and probabilistic models for wave impact and wave overtopping. This model system was used to determine the area of borrow pits required to supply clay for adequate dikes under different sea-level rise scenarios. For medium to high sea-level rise scenarios (>102 cm by 2100) thickening of the clay layer on the dike is required to compensate for the larger waves resulting from insufficient marsh accretion. The model results indicate that for our case study roughly 9.4 ha of borrow pit is sufficient to supply clay for 1 km of dike reinforcement until 2100. The simulated borrow pits are refilled within 22 simulation years on average, and infilling is projected to accelerate with sea-level rise and pit depth. This study highlights the potential of salt marshes as an asset for adapting flood defences in the future. © 2018 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Climate change and the overexploitation of natural resources increase the need to integrate sustainable development policies at both national and international levels to fit the demands of a growing population. In 2015 the United Nations (UN) established the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development with the aim of eradicating extreme poverty, reducing inequality and protecting the planet. The Agenda 2030 highlights the importance of biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems to maintain economic activities and the well-being of local communities. Nature Based Solutions (NBS) support biodiversity conservation and the functioning of ecosystems. NBS are increasingly seen as innovative solutions to manage water-related risks while transforming natural capital into a source of green growth and sustainable development. In this context, NBS could potentially contribute to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting the delivery of bundles of ecosystem services together generating various social, economic and environmental co-benefits. However, to achieve the full potential of NBS, it is necessary to recognize the trade-offs and synergies of the co-benefits associated with their implementation. To this aim, we have adopted a system perspective and a multi-sectoral approach to analyse the potential of NBS to deliver co-benefits while at the same time reducing the negative effects of water-related hazards. Using the case study of Copenhagen, we have analysed the relationships between the co-benefits associated with the scenario of the restoration of the Ladegaardsaa urban river. Our hypothesis is that enhancing the understanding of the social, economic and environmental factors of the system, including mutual influences and trade-offs, could improve the decision-making process and thereby enhance the capability of NBS to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. © 2020',\n",
       " 'Promoting green infrastructure and other nature-based solutions in urban environments is considered an effective approach to achieve resilience and meet sustainability goals. Countries with a post-Socialist history are still struggling to increase the amount of green spaces in cities. Bucharest is an example of a city that has undergone considerable transformation during the Socialist period (1948–1990)and after. Back then the drivers of urban transformation were mainly related to public land management, whereas after the fall of the Socialist regime private development prevailed. Our study aims to analyze the shift in the amount and distribution of green spaces in Bucharest as a consequence of the transition from a centralized planning system to a market-based system. We used historical maps and aerial images to determine spatial-temporal changes in the structure of Bucharest‘s urban parks and their surrounding areas. To determine the influence of planning approaches on green spaces, we analyzed the legislative framework from the Socialist period (labeled as “red”)and post-Socialist period. Our results showed that the fall of the Socialist regime represented an important institutional change affecting urban green spaces. There was a major increase in the surface and number of green spaces during the Socialist period and a decrease afterwards as a consequence of a weak legislative framework, restitution of lands and ownership conflicts. Our findings provide valuable knowledge on the evolutionary urban processes and sustainability approaches of the post-Socialist period in Romania and important insights for improving planning efforts and maximizing ecosystem services in cities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) are inspired and supported by nature but designed by humans. Historically, governmental stakeholders have aimed to control nature using a top-down approach; more recently, environmental governance has shifted to collaborative planning. Polycentric governance and co-creation procedures, which include a large spectrum of stakeholders, are assumed to be more effective in the management of public goods than traditional approaches. In this context, NBS projects should benefit from strong collaborative governance models, and the European Union is facilitating and encouraging such models. While some theoretical approaches exist, setting-up the NBS co-creation process (namely co-design and co-implementation) currently relies mostly on self-organized stakeholders rather than on strategic decisions. As such, systematic methods to identify relevant stakeholders seem to be crucial to enable higher planning efficiency, reduce bottlenecks and time needed for planning, designing, and implementing NBS. In this context, this contribution is based on the analysis of 16 NBS and 359 stakeholders. Real-life constellations are compared to theoretical typologies, and a systematic stakeholder mapping method to support co-creation is presented. Rather than making one-fit-all statements about the “right” stakeholders, the contribution provides insights for those “in charge” to strategically consider who might be involved at each stage of the NBS project. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'The cost-effective mitigation of climate change through nature-based carbon dioxide removal strategies has gained substantial policy attention. Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH 4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget =-28.1 ± 19.13 gC m-2 y-1) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 ± 100.6 gCO 2 eq-1 m-2 y-1). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH 4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH 4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US$4200-49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation. © 2020 The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Within South East Asia, certification and local market development may play an important role in incentivizing farmers to continue with nature-based solutions delivered by organic or traditional farming practices and avoid using environmentally detrimental production techniques. The purpose of this study is to use economic valuation in order to achieve an empirical understanding of local consumer preferences for different attributes of rice products. Application of the agrarian system approach reveals that rice cultivation systems observed in the Tonle Sape Lake of the Mekong River Basin in Cambodia (our study case) may target three ecosystem services that present the characteristics of public goods and may benefit consumer support. A choice experiment survey was administered among local consumers in the city of Phnom Penh in 2013. Econometric analysis indicates high rate of non-attendance for the price attribute. It also suggests that 17% of the respondents made their choices neglecting attributes describing ecosystem services. However, there are evidence of consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for certified organic rice higher than the price-premium observed on the local market. Furthermore, there is additional WTP value for the preservation of ecosystem services.

       " 'Urbanization alters natural hydrological processes and enhances runoff, which affects flood hazard. Interest in nature-based solutions (NBS) for sustainable mitigation and adaptation to urban floods is growing, but the magnitudes of NBS effects are still poorly investigated. This study explores the potential of NBS for flood hazard mitigation in a small peri-urban catchment in central Portugal, prone to flash floods driven by urbanization and short but intense rainfall events typical of the Mediterranean region. Flood extent and flood depth are assessed by manually coupling the hydrologic HEC-HMS and hydraulic HEC-RAS models. The coupled model was run for single rainfall events with recurrence periods of 10−, 20−, 50−, and 100−years, considering four simulation scenarios: current conditions (without NBS), and with an upslope NBS, a downslope NBS, and a combination of both. The model-simulation approach provides good estimates of flood magnitude (NSE = 0.91, RMSE = 0.08, MAE = 0.07, R2 = 0.93), and shows that diverting streamflow into abandoned fields has positive impacts in mitigating downslope flood hazard. The implementation of an upslope NBS can decrease the water depth at the catchment outlet by 0.02 m, whereas a downslope NBS can reduce it from 0.10 m to 0.23 m for increasing return periods. Combined upslope and downslope NBS have a marginal additional impact in reducing water depth, ranging from 0.11 m to 0.24 m for 10− and 100−year floods. Decreases in water depth provided by NBS are useful in flood mitigation and adaptation within the peri-urban catchment. A network of NBS, rather than small isolated strategies, needs to be created for efficient flood-risk management at a larger scale. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Urban expansion leads to surface changes that disrupt hydrological processes and increases flooding risks in cities. This increase may be severe in urban megaregions where clusters of cites have agglomerated. The China Ecological Redline Policy (ERP) is a national policy that protects priority areas with high-value ecosystem services. However, it is not clear how the ERP alters megaregion expansion and what this means for surface runoff across entire regions. By integrating specified models, we developed future urban expansion scenarios for 2030 with and without the ERP in the Chinese Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) megaregion. The annual surface runoff volume under the ERP scenario decreased by 78 million m3 compared to the non-ERP involved scenario, but the ERP effectiveness at surface runoff regulation was different between the ecological redline areas (ERAs) and the non-ERAs. This suggested that multi-solutions should be incorporated into megaregions, such as regional ERPs and local, nature-based solutions, which could efficiently reduce the risk of urban flooding across whole regions. © 2020 The Author(s).

       " 'Urbanization impacts stream ecosystems globally through degraded water quality, altered hydrology, and landscape disturbances at the catchment and riparian scales, causing biodiversity losses and altered system functioning. Addressing the “urban stream syndrome” requires multiple mitigation tools, and rehabilitation of riparian vegetation may help improve stream ecological status and provide key ecosystem services. However, the extent to which forested riparian buffers can help support stream biodiversity in the face of numerous environmental contingencies remains uncertain. We assessed how a key indicator of stream ecological status, benthic diatoms, respond to riparian habitat conditions using 10 urban site pairs (each comprising of one unbuffered and one buffered reach), and additional urban downstream and forest reference upstream sites in the Oslo Fjord basin. Diatom communities were structured by multiple drivers including spatial location, land use, water quality, and instream habitat. Among these, riparian habitat condition independently explained 16% of variation in community composition among site pairs. Changes in community structure and indicator taxa, along with a reduction in pollution-tolerant diatoms, suggested tangible benefits of forested riparian buffers for stream biodiversity in urban environments. Managing urban impacts requires multiple solutions, with forested riparian zones providing a potential tool to help improve biodiversity and ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'This study offers a Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for the recovery of long-term oil-polluted soils. An NPK-type substituted organic fertilizer (SOF) was formulated using available nature-based materials, and its effect on bacterial diversity, richness and community composition investigated during the remediation of a long-term crude oil-impacted soil. Results obtained were compared to a control and a chemical fertilizer (CF) treatment. The rate of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) degradation was observed to be highest in the SOF treatment (0.022 d – 1) compared to the CF (0.016 d – 1) and control treatments (0.001 d – 1). Improvement of bacterial diversity in the SOF treatment significantly correlated with pH and soil organic matter (SOM). Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum across all the treatment systems. Acidocella was dominant in both the control and CF treatments, while Brevundimonas and Alcanivorax were the most abundant genera in the SOF treatment. The bacterial community structure and composition were significantly differentiated (PERMANOVA, p ≤ 0.01) in the different treatment processes. Constrained redundancy analysis revealed that pH, SOM, calcium, TPH and potassium influences the bacterial community composition. Analysis of bacterial community interaction suggests that there was higher efficiency in information processing and chemical transmission in the SOF treatment compared to the CF treatment. PICRUSt2-based functional prediction revealed that dissimilatory/assimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification were among biomarkers in the nutrient amended treatments, while enzymes for nitrogen fixation were differentially abundant in the control treatment. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that the formulated NbS-fertilizer might stimulate more rapid biodegradation by improving soil nutrients and the proliferation of diverse microbial species in oil-polluted soils. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'In the last decades, green roofs have been proposed among several nature-based solutions, as promising and sustainable tools to mitigate urban flood risk and adapt to climate changes. Several vegetation types have been suggested as green roof top layers, depending on the region and the purpose of the roof. In a Mediterranean climate, the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) vegetation represents a particularly advantageous choice for green roofs since it does not require artificial irrigation and maintenance. However, the flood mitigation performance of CAM green roofs has not been investigated as adequately as other vegetation types. In this framework, we aim to define the potential retention capacity of a no maintenance-cost spontaneous CAM green roof, located at the entrance of the University of Cagliari (Italy) and to compare it to C3 vegetation type. The structure has been equipped with gauges to measure the water fluxes in and out of the roof. Local observations are used to calibrate a conceptual ecohydrological model. A 51-year rainfall time series and corresponding potential evapotranspiration are then used to simulate and compare the relative performance of green roofs vegetated with spontaneous CAM and more common C3 plants. Results show the good performances of the CAM green roof in mitigating rainfall extremes, with an average retention capacity of 0.52 over the whole investigated period, while C3 presents an index of retention equal to 0.71, but it requires frequent irrigation. Moreover, this work highlights some potential economic and environmental benefits of CAM green roof implementation in Mediterranean areas. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Using local and recycled materials is a sustainable way to establish a vegetated roof. In order to understand how the roof ecosystem functions and returns ecosystem services, it is important to study vegetation, soil organisms and runoff quality. We established a vegetated roof experiment based on a substrate containing lightweight crushed concrete, an alkaline side product from a concrete factory, mixed with compost. This five-year experiment in southern Finland tested how planting method (pre-grown vegetation mats vs. pot planting), compost content (20% vs. 40%, fresh volume), and substrate depth affect the cover and diversity of plants, the abundance of soil animals and the quality of runoff. Although the substrate had a high pH (7.3–11.8), many vascular plants were able to survive and establish viable populations. The planting method had a strong effect on plant diversity and the cover of individual species because the vegetation mats became dominated by the invasive, non-native Phedimus hybridus. Establishment with pot plants in turn provided bare ground that was colonised by spontaneous non-invasive species. This resulted in higher diversity, and a more even distribution of species. The amount of compost had only a weak impact on vegetation, whereas high pH generally reduced plant abundance and diversity. The concentrations of total phosphorus and total nitrogen in runoff were low as compared to values reported from many other vegetated roofs, were not affected by compost content and decreased over time. In summary, the high-pH substrate based on recycled materials is an environmentally responsible choice, suitable for a wide variety of plants, even rare and endangered species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Hybrid (or multi-actor) governance has been identified as a key opportunity for upscaling urban nature-based solutions (referred to as urban NBS), representing a demand-driven and cost-effective realization of urban green infrastructure. However it is unclear how such hybrid governance affects the justice outcomes of urban NBS. Through six in-depth cases of urban NBS we show that hybrid governance can lead to both improvements and deterioration of distributional, procedural and recognition justice, depending on the hybrid governance choices. By exploring the tensions between these justice impacts we formulate three main policy implications for hybrid governance settings: the need for transparent decision-making on the distribution of costs and benefits; safeguarding public control over the urban NBS and the use of scientific expertise in combination with bottom-up consultation procedures to recognize both current and future voices. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'The severity of environmental threats, especially climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, are well established, as is the urgent need for them to be addressed. These threats act both in isolation as well as synergistically to contribute to overall ‘environmental breakdown’. Debate exists around the most optimal governance and policy approaches to address these threats and, to date, little quantitative evidence exists to compare the different approaches. Using a modified Bayesian belief network model to assess the probability of environmental threats, we compare and contrast a range of proposed policy solutions to a selection of contemporary environmental problems that have been identified as having the potential to contribute to, or indeed may lead to environmental breakdown. Through interrogation of the models, we conclude that policies that prioritise economic growth at the expense of nature would be largely ineffective, whereas a more integrated approach, adopting comprehensive ‘Green New Deal’ policies combined with nature-based solutions would be the most effective approaches to preventing environmental breakdown, as they address societal and environmental issues simultaneously. We therefore recommend that decision makers take an integrated approach to decision making and policy development, accounting for social, economic and environmental drivers that ensure delivery of multiple benefits and real change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Although green interventions, like nature-based solutions, contribute to more sustainable urban environments and provide ecosystem services to urban populations, some impacts are not well understood. This particularly applies to social impacts in the domain of environmental justice, including (green) gentrification. Gentrification refers to a process in which green urban renewal raises property prices, which results in an influx of affluent people, displacing poorer residents. Our study conducts a meta-analysis based on 37 primary hedonic pricing studies, to estimate value transfer functions that can assess the effects of nature types on property prices in various urban settings. Urban nature has positive impacts on house value in the areas surrounding it, which depend on population density, distance to, and the type of, urban nature. We illustrate how the estimated benefit transfer function can be applied to natural interventions in a Dutch city, and visualize the obtained effects using mapping. These maps show the distance decay of the cumulative effects of urban nature interventions on the house value at the city and the neighbourhood levels. Our application estimated increases in local property values up to a maximum of 20 % compared with properties not affected by the interventions, with value equivalent of 62,650 USD, at average prevailing price level in a particular area in Utrecht. When new nature is being planned in urban areas our mapping approach can be used for guiding assessments of potential undesirable effects on property values that may lead to green gentrification, and for identifying where additional policies may be needed to contribute to environmental justice. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'The aim of the paper was to present the procedure of building neighborhood resilience to climate threats, embedded in planning (from the strategic to local level) and design process and focused on usage of natural adaptive potential. The presented approach encompasses: (1) the strategic identification of focal areas in terms of climate adaptation needs, (2) comprehensive diagnosis of local ecological vulnerability and natural adaptive potential to build adaptive capacity, and (3) incorporation of natural adaptive potential through an identified set of planning and design tools. For diagnosis and strategic environmental impact assessment, the multicriteria analysis has been elaborated. The described procedure is applied to the City of Warsaw on the strategic level, by elaboration of the ranking of districts in terms of priority to take adaptation actions based on climatic threats, demographic vulnerability, and assessment of Warsaw Green Infrastructure potential. For further analysis at the planning and design stage, the district with the most urgent adaptation needs has been chosen, and within its borders, two neighborhoods (existing and planned one) with diagnosed ecological sensitivity were selected. Both case studies were analyzed in terms of environmental conditions, urban structure, and planning provisions. It enabled identification of existing natural adaptive potential and assessment of its use. As a result, propositions for enhancing neighborhood resilience to climate change were suggested. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.',\n",
       " 'Plants provide many ecosystem services in urban environments, including improving ambient air quality. Leaves of plants permit the deposition of particulate matter (PM) and, depending on their leaf traits, PM may be immobilized within the epicuticular wax (EW) layer, on trichomes, on hyphae of fungi, or inside stomatal cavities. In this study, leaves of 96 perennial urban plant species consisting of 45 deciduous broadleaf/needle-like trees, 32 deciduous broadleaf shrubs, 12 evergreen needle/scale-like trees, 5 evergreen broadleaf trees, and 2 climber species were investigated in June and September 2016 to determine the effectiveness of distinct leaf surfaces in PM immobilization after leaf washing treatment. The leaf surfaces were washed vigorously using a vortex shaker. The magnetizable component of accumulated and immobilized PM on the leaf surfaces was estimated using saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) of the unwashed and washed leaves, respectively. In June, the washed leaf SIRM of deciduous (broadleaf/needle-like) tree and shrub species (n = 77) ranged between 0.1 and 13.9 μA. In September, the washed leaf SIRM of all investigated plant species (n = 96) ranged between 1.2 and 35.0 μA. Outcomes of this study indicate that leaves of Buddleja davidii, Viburnum lantana, and Sorbus intermedia showed the highest washed leaf SIRM and thus were the most effective in immobilizing PM on their leaf surfaces while leaves of Populus alba, Robinia pseudoacacia, and Abies fraseri with lowest washed leaf SIRM were the least effective. On average, more than half (i.e., 60%) of the magnetic signal still remained after vigorous washing but a large variation exists between species (9–96%). The leaf SIRM of washed leaves of deciduous broadleaf tree and shrub species was significantly higher compared to leaves of evergreen needle/scale-like species. Evidently, the magnetic signal of unwashed leaves was higher than washed ones and higher in September than in June. Leaf traits significantly influenced the magnetic signal of both washed and unwashed leaves: leaves with a high trichome density or high leaf wettability showed a higher unwashed and washed leaf SIRM compared to leaves with no trichomes or low leaf wettability. The effect of epicuticular wax structure types on leaf SIRM was indicated to be only marginally significant. Moreover, also the immobilized fraction of PM was significantly affected by trichome density and leaf wettability, thus substantiating that plant species with high trichome density and/or leaf wettability not only accumulate more PM but are also less prone to PM re-suspension than other species. In general, the results also indicate that leaf SIRM of unwashed leaves can be a good indicator to determine the effectiveness of a plant species in PM immobilization. Plant species effective in immobilizing PM on their leaf surfaces may likely improve ambient air quality when planted in urban environments. However, it is vital that leaves of these plant species (i.e., with high PM immobilization abilities) are carefully recycled as they may be polluted. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'This paper highlights the effects of sealed surfaces in flood hazard in order to identify population exposure to heavy rain within Cabras watershed located in Campinas Metropolitan Area (Sao Paulo). We applied a set of methods compiled into an integrated system by the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of University of Sao Paulo (USP). We observed that, for relatively frequent flood events with 10y of return periods, changes in LULC represent an increase of maximum water depths that vary up to 0,036 m to 0,043 m, respectively. For less frequent events, with return periods of 100y, the maximum increase of water depth varies from 0,064 m to 0,071 m. Although the water depth reached is not considered risky (e.g., for an adult walking in flows), the water velocity (v = 2,32 m/s) and the amount of water downhill (∼5,000 litters) are considered high (i.e. pedestrians can be swept along streets during major storm events). Our scenarios project more than 5,000 people exposed, with a significant parcel at slums. Summarizing, an explicit innovation strategy helped us to identify the number of people at risk in ungauged basins, which can be beneficial for municipal decisions, especially if effectively implemented to reduce disaster risk and nature based solutions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Lawns provide green infrastructure and ecosystem services for anthropized areas. They have a strong impact on the environment in terms of inputs (water and fertilizers) and maintenance. The use of warm-season grasses, such as Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., provides a cost-effective and sustainable lawn in the dry summers of the Mediterranean. In winter, Bermudagrass is dormant and brown, which instead of being a problem could be an opportunity for biodiversity through the coexistence of flowering species. This study assesses the possibility of growing autumn-to-spring-flowering bulbs and forbs with Bermudagrass, to provide ecosystem services in urban areas. Eight geophytes and 18 forbs were incorporated into a mature turf of hybrid Bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon × C. transvaalensis cv. “Tifway”. At the same time, a commercial flowering mix was sown in the same conditions. Two different soil preparations, scalping and turf flaming, and two different nitrogen doses, 50 and 150\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1, were carried out before sowing and transplanting. The flowering plants were counted. All the bulbs and six of the 18 forbs were able to grow and flower in the first and second years. The commercial mix was in full bloom from April until the cutting time for the hybrid Bermudagrass, at the end of May. Adding the flowering species did not affect the healthy growth of the warm-season grass. The fertilization dose had no effect, while turf flaming led to a wider spread of Bellis perennis L. and Crocus spp. Several flower-visiting insects were observed in the spring. © 2020, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.',\n",
       " 'Cities increasingly have to find innovative ways to address challenges arising from climate change and urbanization. Nature-based solutions (NBS) have been gaining attention as multifunctional solutions that may help cities to address these challenges. However, the adoption and implementation of these solutions have been limited due to various barriers. This study aims to identify a taxonomy of dominant barriers to the uptake and implementation of NBS and their relationships. Fifteen barriers are identified from the literature and expert interviews and then ranked through a questionnaire. Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) serves to identify the mutual interdependencies among these barriers, which results in a structural model of six levels. Subsequently, Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC analysis) is used to classify the barriers into four categories. The results suggest that political, institutional and knowledge-related barriers are the most dominant barriers to NBS. Cities that intend to apply NBS can draw on these findings, especially by more effectively prioritizing and managing their actions. © 2020 The Author(s)',\n",
       " \"Worldwide, a large set of initiatives have been carried out aiming to understand the benefits offered by Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in urban areas. The European Commission (EC) has founded different projects that have performed scientific literature reviews regarding this topic. To objectively compare their results and consolidate the consensus about the impacts and benefits of NBS, we performed a text mining analysis. This methodology coupled with a visual representation of the data allowed to convert the EC funding projects reports (corpus) into a meaningful structured analysis. This method demonstrated that despite the different literature review methodologies of each report, there are common trends exhibited by the results, e.g., the NBS installation as a strategy of urban resilience, the recognition of ecosystem services (ESS) delivered by nature in urban spaces, or the importance of the EC's supporting role in the promotion of NBS. In addition, some network specific trends have also emerged and complemented the analysis: the assessment of the NBS performance with indicators, the participatory planning approach to NBS (involving citizen and local communities) and the economic value of their services. © 2020 by the authors.\",\n",

This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",

       " 'In 2014, the Paraíba do Sul River Basin Integration Committee (CEIVAP) established its Pilot Program of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), focusing on water resources. The projects from this program share the same goal: to disseminate the use of PES as a tool for land management in watersheds. Contemplating 11 municipalities, including 84 landowners, conserving 718.63 ha and restoring 188.58 ha, this program was concluded in April 2020. Reviewing its historical and contextualizing features, we have observed that the outcomes from this program extend beyond these numbers. Here, we propose an evaluation methodology comparing the efficiency, performance, and impact of the PES projects. Based on new indicators that are easy to measure, we have identified key elements that have asymmetrically affected the projects. The complexity of the project scope and the execution of high-cost, and risky interventions on rural properties, have resulted in expensive projects with little tangible outputs. Our results support the upgrade of public policy for investment in ecosystem services by CEIVAP in the Paraíba do Sul watershed. In addition, our results can be more successful by improving the decision-making processes for similar projects in other watersheds. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'Hydraulic engineering infrastructures, such as reservoirs, dikes, breakwaters, and inlet closures, have significantly impacted ecosystem functioning over the last two centuries. Currently, nature-based solutions are receiving increasing attention in hydraulic engineering projects and research programs. However, there is a lack of reflection on the concomitant, fundamental changes occurring in the field of hydraulic engineering, and coastal engineering in particular, and what this could mean for sustainability. In this article, we signal the shift from conventional to ecosystem-based hydraulic engineering design and characterize this in terms of four continua: (i) the degree of inclusion of ecological knowledge, (ii) the extent to which the full infrastructural lifecycle is addressed, (iii) the complexity of the actor arena taken into account, and (iv) the resulting form of the infrastructural artefact. We support our arguments with two carefully selected, iconic examples from the Netherlands and indicate how the stretching ideals of ecosystem-based engineering could engender further shifts towards sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'Social learning, especially triple-loop social learning involving institutional and governance changes, has great potential to address urban water issues such as flooding, drought, and pollution. It facilitates urban transition and the adoption of more systemic approaches and innovations. Social learning in water governance is a growing field, but the triple-loop learning concept remains vague and underexplored. Additionally, the focus is often on how social learning can contribute to progress with little attention being paid to barriers to learning. The aim of this paper is to increase understanding of triple-loop social learning to improve the \"learning infrastructure\". It investigates key learning barriers for realizing green (livable) and adaptive cities in Malmö and Gothenburg, Sweden. Integration of nature-based solutions in spatial planning and development of these cities has been slow. The results found three types of barriers contributing to this: systemic (disconnecting parts with the whole); opacity (reducing communication between error detection and correction); and process-related (reducing the adoption of innovations). The paper contributes to understanding the social learning barriers for implementing planning. These insights could help overcome \"adaptation inertia\" and speed up policy learning towards sustainability and resilience. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",

A total of 11 hypotheses were set to achieve the research goals, and an empirical analysis was conducted based on a total of 309 pieces of data collected from 320 hotel employees who are currently working in 11 hotels in South Korea. As a result, eight hypotheses were accepted and three were rejected. Specifically, it was found that the hotel’s nature-friendly environment reduced burnout in employees, and indirectly had a significant effect on job satisfaction and job performance. Therefore, the relationship between the variables presented was clearly demonstrated through the research results, and the purpose of this study was satisfactorily explained.

       " 'Many urbanized areas in tropical climate regions are coping with water contamination due to inadequate sewage collection, particularly in communities that inhabit marginal land of rapid-growth. Relying on large-scale Waste-Water Treatment Plants -WWTPs and implementation of traditional sewage collection infrastructures have proven limited success to cope with the mentioned problem. Alternatives based on Nature-based Solutions - NbS, have the potential to deliver des-centralized treatment as well as additional socio-environmental benefits for the improvement of urban poor conditions. This research focused on modelling cost-efficiency and environmental performance of Nb-S implemented in fast-growing urban areas of the developing countries. A Horizontal Sub-Surface Flow Constructed Wetland - HSSF-CW is proposed to perform as complementary cost-effective decentralized treatment of local sewage. P-K-C* model is applied as sizing approach of the system for a 60% minimum removal of Biological Oxygen Demand - BOD in the influent. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) has been used to analyse the feasibility of the CW proposal with environmental performance of CW modelled through shadow prices methodology. Shadow prices of contaminants, i.e. phosphorus, nitrogen and BOD, act as a proxy of environmental benefit in monetary units, allowing to include the environmental performance of CW into CBA. This new method combines both P-K-C* sizing approach and environmental performance through shadow prices to enhance best allocation of resources for water treatment. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.',\n",
       " 'Urban, industrial, and agricultural development in river basins has resulted in the pollution of estuarine and coastal ecosystems with a great amount of organic microcontaminants (OMCs) such as pesticides and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). This study takes the Ebro Delta as a case study to assess the increase or reduction of 25 OMCs in rice fields and one 86 ha constructed wetland (CW). Bentazone and MCPA were the most abundant pesticides in the rice-field drainage water, with a peak concentration of 21,318 and 938 ng/L respectively, whereas the greatest CEC concentrations were found for caffeine, benzotriazoles, and bisphenol A (20–71 ng/L, on average) in the rice irrigation water. Pesticide concentration increased after the irrigation water passed through the rice fields (from 102 to 1973 ng/L, on average), but CECs present in the irrigation water decreased by 37% (from 14 to 10 ng/L, on average). A mass balance study showed that the CW was capable of reducing OMCs by 67%. Risk assessment analysis showed that the cumulative hazard quotient for Daphnia magna, green algae, and fish was greater than 1 during several sampling campaigns for the rice-field drainage water, but the CW was capable of reducing it by 60–63%, resulting in values below 1, which indicates that the risk was not significant. The results thus indicate that rice fields reduce CECs, but increase pesticides, whereas the use of CWs seems to be a feasible nature-based solution to reduce the discharge of OMCs into estuarine and coastal areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Large-scale barriers are a management option for present and increasing coastal storm flooding. The barriers have gates that are open most times except during storms. As an example of the assessment process for a barrier, an integrated assessment of two barrier options for the coastal city of Boston, located in the northeastern USA, is presented. The assessment also included a comparison to shore-based adaptation options such as elevated walkways, playing fields, and open space. While harbor-wide barriers in Boston could manage storm coastal flooding with perhaps minimal environmental impacts and moderate impacts on harbor users such as shipping, their cost-effectiveness is low. Their operational lives are limited by a rapidly increasing annual number of gate closures over time as sea level rises—placing considerable mechanical stresses on them. With low potential to adapt or adjust a barrier once it is in place, there are limited opportunities to respond to the uncertainties of climate change over time. The alternative of a wide spectrum of shore-based, district-level solutions using nature-based solutions located on the waterfront, however, has the potential for high cost-effectiveness and several key advantages. These solutions have the potential to incorporate multiple levels of protection, manage storm and tidal coastal flooding, provide flexibility and adaptability, offer co-benefits, endure for long operational lifetimes, and cause minimal impacts to the environment and harbor users. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.',\n",

However, how different elements and types of natural environments associate with mental health is still largely unknown. In this study, we perform a detailed analysis on a large, nation-wide data set of mental health records (908 553 individuals) for Denmark combined with remotely-sensed land cover and vegetation density data. We explore associations between growing up surrounded by different environments and rates of a spectrum of 18 psychiatric disorders. Childhood land cover exposure for urban, agricultural, near-natural green space, and blue space was determined around the residence of each individual. Vegetation density and air pollution were evaluated as potential pathways. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate rates as hazard ratios and then adjusted for potential confounding from other known risk factors. For 12 of 18 disorders, rates were lower for children growing up in environments with more natural elements (near-natural green space, blue space, and agriculture) compared to children growing up in urban environments. High vegetation density was associated with lower rates for most disorders within all the examined environments, whereas mitigation of air pollution by natural environments seemed a less important potential pathway. Rates were not notably changed by adjustment for urbanization, parental and municipal socioeconomic status, family history of mental illness, and parents’ age. In conclusion, we found that growing up surrounded by a range of natural environments such as near-natural green space, blue space, and agriculture may lower rates of psychiatric disorders.

       " 'As the frequency and intensity of storms increase, a growing need exists for resilient shore protection techniques that have both environmental and economic benefits. In addition to producing seafood, aquaculture farms may also provide coastal protection benefits either alone or with other nature-based structures. In this paper, a generalized three-layer frequency dependent theoretical model is derived for random wave attenuation due to presence of biomass within the water column. The biomass can be characterized as submerged, emerged, suspended and floating canopies that can consist of natural aquatic vegetation with potential aquaculture systems of kelp or mussels. The present analytical solutions can reduce to the solutions by Mendez and Losada (2004), Chen and Zhao (2012) and Jacobsen et al. (2019) for submerged rigid aquatic vegetation. The present theoretical model incorporates the motion of these canopies using a cantilever-beam model for slender components and a buoy-on-rope model for elements with concentrated mass and buoyancy. Analytical results are compared with existing laboratory and field datasets for submerged and suspended canopies. The theoretical model was then used (in a case study at a field site in Northeastern US) to investigate the capacity of suspended mussel farms with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) to dissipate wave energy during a recent storm event. Compared to a dense SAV meadow in shallower water, the suspended aquaculture farms more effectively attenuate random waves with a smaller peak period and the higher frequency components of wave spectrum. The performance of suspended aquaculture farms is less affected by water level changes due to tides, surge and sea level rise, while the wave attenuation performance of SAV decreases with increasing water level due to decreased wave motion near the sea bed. Incorporating suspended aquaculture farms offshore significantly enhance the coastal protection effectiveness of SAV-based living shorelines and extend the wave attenuation capacity over a wider wave period and water level range. The combination of suspended aquaculture farms and traditional living shorelines provides a more effective nature-based coastal defense strategy than the traditional living shorelines alone. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

The cost of the straw is 22.5% of the total income of the farmers. We found that their perception was negative about the use of straw mulch, as the tradition is to keep the soil clean from any weed or cover, except the crop. However, farmers would use it if they would be subsidized with a minimum of €267\\xa0ha−1, which is €92\\xa0ha−1 more than the costs estimated on the basis of the surveys.

       " 'Due to their widespread use in industrial applications in recent decades, Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals (HMs) are the most common soil contaminants worldwide, posing a risk for both ecosystems and human health. In this study, a poplar-assisted bioremediation strategy has been applied for more than 4 years to a historically contaminated area (PCBs and HMs) in Southern Italy using the Monviso poplar clone. This clone was effective in promoting a decrease in all contaminants and an increase in soil quality in terms of organic carbon and microbial abundance. Moreover, a significant shift in the structure and predicted function of the belowground microbial community was also observed when analyzing both DNA and cDNA sequencing data. In fact, an increase in bacterial genera belonging to Proteobacteria able to degrade PCBs and resist HMs was observed. Moreover, the functional profiling of the microbial community predicted by PICRUSt2 made it possible to identify several genes associated with PCB transformation (e.g., bphAa, bphAb, bphB, bphC), response to HM oxidative stress (e.g., catalase, superoxide reductase, peroxidase) and HM uptake and expulsion (e.g., ABC transporters). This work demonstrated the effectiveness of the poplar clone Monviso in stimulating the natural belowground microbial community to remove contaminants and improve the overall soil quality. It is a practical example of a nature based solution involving synergic interactions between plants and the belowground microbial community. © Copyright © 2020 Barra Caracciolo, Grenni, Garbini, Rolando, Campanale, Aimola, Fernandez-Lopez, Fernandez-Gonzalez, Villadas and Ancona.',\n",

Drawing from different ecological and biological disciplines, we identify a series of actions to sustain the resilience of marine habitat-forming species to climate change, as well as their effectiveness and reliability in rescuing stress-sensitive species from increasingly adverse environmental conditions. © 2018 Bulleri et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.',\n",
       " 'The aim of this work was to determine the competencies that need to be included in engineering programs to develop water infrastructure based on Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in the urban context, focused on its application in developing countries. Thus, the work was developed in three phases: i) a theoretical phase, ii) a validation phase and iii) a statistical analysis. For the theoretical phase, a literature review was conducted to determine a set of competencies for developing these type of projects. Next, in the validation phase, fifty participants were invited to complete a two-round Delphi questionnaire to rank the competencies detected in the literature review. The participants were classified according to their level of knowledge (skilled or expert) and place of work (countries with upper-middle-income or high-income). The results showed that twenty-one competencies were identified. In the validation phase, for the first Delphi round, the different groups studied (skilled vs expert; high-income vs upper-middle-income) did not agree about the most important competencies. However, after the second Delphi round, an agreement was achieved. Therefore, competencies related to water quality and process design for improving its quality were defined as “extremely important” competencies. In addition, the entire panel of experts also highlighted competencies related to legislation, circular economy, equipment, climate, and construction materials. Thus, for the first time, a set of competencies that needs to be included in educational programs for engineers with a special focus on developing water infrastructure based on NBS in the urban context of developing countries has been proposed in this work. © 2020',\n",
       " 'In this study, we have evaluated the efficiency of a chemical fractionation procedure for the characterization of both the water-soluble and the insoluble fraction of the main elemental components of particulate matter (PM) deposited on urban leaves. The proposed analytical approach is based on the chemical analysis of leaf washing solutions and membrane filters used for their filtration. The ionic concentration of leaf washing solutions was compared with their electrical conductivity, making it a valuable proxy for the quantification of the water-soluble and ionic fraction of leaf deposited PM. The chemical composition of both the water-soluble and the insoluble fraction of PM, resulting from this fractionation procedure, was compared with results obtained by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersed X-Rays spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and processed through chemometrics. Results obtained proved that the proposed approach is able to provide an estimation of total leaf deposited PM and it is highly reliable for the evaluation of the emission impact of different PM sources, being able to increase the selectivity of PM elemental components as specific source tracers; consequently providing useful information also for the assessment of human health risks. © 2020 by the authors.

       " \"Since the start of stream daylighting (deculverting streams buried to make way for urban development) in the 1970s, several case study/project-based reviews emerged. Yet, there is a need for literature-based reviews that identify the literature's themes, interconnections, pressing issues, and knowledge gaps. Therefore, we combine the systematic review and content analysis methods to investigate 115 peer-reviewed and grey literature publications on stream daylighting. Our findings reveal temporal shifts in the multi-/inter-disciplinary clustering patterns of the identified nine themes and 53 sub-themes. Furthermore, there is a dearth in this literature on ‘built form and urban design’, ‘inclusive planning’, and on case studies from the Global South. Last, the connections are absent between stream daylighting and nature-based solutions and climate change adaptation (e.g., vis-à-vis stormwater management, urban heat island, and rainwater harvesting) and climate mitigation (decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, such as through enhancing the opportunities for walkability, cycling, and connections to transit). © 2020 The Author(s)\",\n",
       " 'Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is being carried out across the world to meet ambitious global goals. However, the scale of these efforts combined with the timeframe in which they are supposed to take place may compromise the quality of restoration, and thus limit the persistence of restoration on the landscape. This paper presents a synthesis of ten case studies identified as FLR to critically analyse implemented initiatives, their outcomes, and main challenges, with an eye to improving future efforts. The identified FLR projects are diverse in terms of their spatial coverage, objectives; types of interventions; and initial socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental conditions. The six principles of FLR-which have been widely adopted in theory by large global organisations-are inadequately addressed across the initiatives presented here. The identified FLR project or interventions, although expected to offer diverse benefits, face many challenges including the lack of long-term sustainability of project interventions, limited uptake by regional and national agencies, limited monitoring, reporting and learning, poor governance structures, and technical barriers, which are mainly owing to institutional weaknesses. On the basis of these cases, we propose that the best pathway to achieving FLR is via an incremental process in which a smaller number of more achievable objectives are set and implemented over time, rather than setting highly ambitious targets that implementers struggle to achieve. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'The water quality deteriorated in the middle of the 1970s in the Albufera lake, a shallow Mediterranean coastal lagoon in the east coast of Spain. In few years, the water changed from an oligotrophic status to hypereutrophic as the lagoon received sewage and agrochemicals, lacking adequate sanitation facilities. For more than 40 years, the lake was used as a wastewater treatment plant given the urban development in the surrounding area. It was not until the early 1990s, 20 years after the hypereutrophic state was reached, when the first sanitation facility protecting the lake was implemented: a perimeter intercepting sewer carrying out the sewage to a waste water treatment plant. This paper describes the different engineering solutions and tools implemented to improve the water quality in the Albufera lagoon. We describe the measures and their effects on the water quality as well as their limits. Those are sanitation solutions as sewers, wastewaters treatment plants, stormwater detention tanks, and nature based solutions as constructed wetlands that have been used in these years. In addition, the role of agricultural activity in the water balance (quantity and quality), the importance of sediments management and the use of water quality models in environmental engineering have been assessed. Evidences of the improvement of environmental quality are the decrease of mean clorophyll a concentration from 800 μg Chl a l−1 in 1980s to less than 100 μg Chl a l−1 currently observed, the increase of water transparency and the recovery of macrophytes within the lake or the presence of winterbirds which disappeared years ago. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"The twin pressures of climate change and biodiversity loss mean that it is imperative to manage land in ways that benefit carbon storage and biodiversity conservation. We focus on a set of UK habitats of recognised conservation value, first quantifying the carbon stored in the vegetation and top 30 cm of soil in these areas. We estimate that these areas store 0.55 gigatonnes of carbon in vegetation and soil to a depth of 30 cm, approximately 30% of the UK terrestrial carbon store to a similar depth, on 20% of the land area. Most of these high carbon, high conservation value habitats are in upland areas, with particularly notable extents and mass of carbon in Scotland. In their current condition, we estimate these areas to exert a net sequestration effect of more than 8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year. Furthermore, restoration of these habitats from their current, generally poor condition could result in an extra 6–7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year, in the context of the UK's total emissions of 455.9 million tonnes CO2eq in 2017. Restoration of degraded bogs would avoid significant annual emissions (currently negating significant sequestration by woodlands and coastal habitats) and should be a particular priority. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'The concept of urban resilience, particularly through a systems framework, has advanced tremendously over the past decade. Relatedly, collaborative and network governance is increasingly considered essential for the sustainability of urban social-ecological-technical systems. However, empirical evidence explicitly linking metropolitan networks to resilience planning and implementation is sparse. We address this gap by researching a network of organizations pursuing resilience strategies within and across two major metropolitan areas in Texas – Austin and San Antonio. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach that includes qualitative and social network analysis (descriptive and exponential random graph modeling), we examine the factors that drive network formation around blue-green infrastructure in the study area. The planning and implementation of general resilience strategies across metropolitan jurisdictional boundaries is dependent upon the social infrastructure available for governance (i.e., the relationships among organizations engaged in resilience building activities). Our findings demonstrate the tendency for network closure as a key governance feature for resilience implementation. Providing urban policy-makers and planners with information about why networks form can facilitate implementation of blue-green infrastructure in this rapidly growing, climate change impacted region and beyond. Applying a network paradigm provides insights to build general resilience for adaptation and transformation in metropolitan systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"In this paper, we examine how cities are working with nature-based solutions for biodiversity. Drawing on a sample of 199 nature-based solutions across Europe, we identify how cities work with nature-based solutions to conserve nature, restore nature, and to find ways to thrive through harnessing nature's contribution to people. Our findings show that cities are making explicit contributions to biodiversity through nature-based solutions, and often adopt specific and quantifiable targets to guide their actions. Yet there is significant variation in the ways in which biodiversity goals and interventions are being pursued. Where biodiversity goals and actions are included in nature-based solutions, they are mainly ecosystem-based - focusing on the protection, restoration or enhancement of the integrity, functionality, and connectivity of habitats and ecosystems - with fewer focused on specific species, and very few projects concerned with genetic diversity. Although it is often assumed that urban action towards biodiversity goals will be undertaken through local planning processes, our analysis shows that European cities are taking project-based actions for biodiversity through a set of explicit, quantitative and measurable targets, which are tailored to the specific conditions of urban settings. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that if cities are to achieve ambitious goals for biodiversity over the next decade, new international frameworks being developed for the post-2020 period should include targets that acknowledge the way in which biodiversity is governed in cities and the contribution that cities make to conserve, restore and thrive with nature to guide urban action. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Over the past decade, coastal communities and ecosystems in the Northeast United States have begun to face acute and chronic impacts of climate change. Extreme events such as Superstorm Sandy caused stakeholders in this region to examine what information is needed to implement adaptation and mitigation plans to prepare for the next major storm. The objective of this study was to determine research needs identified by stakeholders in the Northeast needed for decision-support and policy creation so that scientists can target future research efforts to fill gaps. Modeled after document analysis methods in Dilling et al. (2014), this study examines documents sourced from local and regional organizations in both the public and private sectors to determine gaps in information necessary for climate resilience planning. Stakeholders throughout the Northeast expressed a need for solution-based research, in particular natural and nature-based solutions such as wetlands. Additionally, there was a need to better understand the economic impacts of climate change on key industries in the region as well as cost-benefit analyses of different adaptation options. It was also determined that government organizations, such as Sea Grant, play a crucial role in supporting stakeholder needs assessments both in terms of funding and providing necessary expertise. This study provides a baseline of stakeholder-expressed research needs in the Northeast to start the conversation between communities and researchers interested in conducting useable science. © 2020 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Wetlands are often acknowledged as a nature-based solution for improving flood resilience in a large river basin. However, the effects of wetlands on floods have not been assessed as extensively within a large river basin, as previous studies have mainly focused on assessing the effect on peak flows of a certain given return period. In this study, a distributed hydrological modeling platform was used to (i) quantify the effect of wetlands on floods with respect to event hydrographs, and (ii) investigate how flood regulation services can occur on the rising and falling limbs of an event hydrograph. Further, we hypothesized that flood resilience depends on the distribution and location of wetlands in the basin. The hydrological modeling study was conducted on a 297,000-km2 large river basin in Northeast China, where wetlands are abundant covering approximately 12% of the basin area. Our modeling study show that wetlands can reduce peak and mean flows, event duration, and flow volume (i.e., runoff volume) by, respectively, 24% (12.14 mm), 12% (4.37 mm), 4% (1 day), and 17% (18 × 108·m3) in this large river basin. The attenuation efficiency of these wetlands varied with their location and size in the basin, especially apparent on peak flow, mean flow and flow volume on the rising limb of a flood event. These findings highlight flood regulation services and attest that wetlands can exhibit different effects; that sometimes they may amplify flood conditions. Thus, wetlands are an important land cover for enhancing resilience to flood events within large river basins, and wetland protection and restoration ought to be important conservation measures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'The use of check-dams in mountain environments to regulate fluxes of water and sediments is widely applied across Mediterranean mountains. Besides the use of “grey infrastructures” such as check-dams, other restoration and hydrological control measures rely more on the use of “green infrastructures” or “nature-based solutions” (e.g. reforestation, buffer lines) or a combination of both types of measures. It is widely accepted that both are complementary, and that prioritization should be based on economic, ecological and cultural criteria. This paper brings together all the knowledge generated during more than one decade concerning the impact of land use changes, reforestation, and hydrological control works on several ecosystem services in a representative Mediterranean catchment. The work evaluates different management scenarios aiming to optimize provision of ecosystem services in the area. The study area is a medium-sized catchment (∼300 km2) in Southeast Spain, representative of Mediterranean mountains that experienced agricultural land abandonment, greening up, and restoration works in the second half of the twentieth century. The methods combined: (i) previous research results for the area that were organized in an ecosystem services framework, providing data for three representative scenarios of catchment management; (ii) the use of value content analysis of the existing management plans for the area to understand the view of the managers; and (iii) a multicriteria analysis of the management scenarios to determine the most sustainable scenario to optimize different ecosystem services. The results of the evaluation were later validated with the stakeholders (technicians and managers involved in the management plans) through interviews. Our results show that solutions that respect landscape and ecological dynamics are more sustainable and cheaper in the medium and long term than scenarios based on “grey infrastructures”, although the latter could have more desirable short-term impacts. The value analysis reflects how there are some concepts, such as ecosystem services, that could easily be further incorporated into several management plans. When choosing a management scenario, this needs to be adapted to the local environmental conditions and to the specific objectives of the restoration works. Tailor-made management scenarios taking into account two factors (local conditions and specific management objectives) can optimize resources and achieve medium to long-term sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Surface urban heat island (SUHI) shows higher surface thermal intensification in urban areas than suburban areas and countryside. Green spaces are widely recognized as the dominant nature-based strategy to mitigate thermal stress. In contrast, natural cooling processes of urban blue spaces are seldom addressed. In this study, we applied the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to map SUHI intensity and blue spaces in order to explore the cooling effect and efficiency of blue spaces in the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (PRD). Significant in-situ cooling is observed, with a 10% increase in water-body coverage leading to a depression of SUHI intensity by 11.33%. The irregular shape of lakes and reservoirs may weaken the cooling effect, but the reshaping of rivers may not. Our results indicate ex-situ cooling spillover of water bodies that will benefit the surrounding areas within an envelope of 100-m effective cooling distance. Such findings underline the importance of urban blue infrastructure in alleviating the thermal discomfort and advocate blue spaces as an essential component of urban infrastructure to minimize the SUHI effect. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'In the context of rapid urbanization and climate change, understanding the impact of urban dynamics on surface runoff is important. For future urban planning, there is a particular knowledge gap regarding the factors that affect surface runoff to improve urban resilience to local flooding. This study explored the impacts of different urban dynamics on surface water runoff considering the surface cover characteristics of different residential types (i.e., low- and high-density settlements) in the city of Munich, Germany. The surface cover characteristics were quantified using the ‘i-Tree Canopy’ method based on high-resolution aerial images. The surface runoff was simulated by the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. Meanwhile, the impacts of different urban dynamics on surface runoff were compared by incorporating a scenario-based urban dynamic modeling approach. The results suggest that, compared with low-density settlements, high-density settlement areas tend to generate more surface runoff within the neighborhood because they have considerably less vegetative surfaces and more built ones. As the development of low-density settlements leads to a greater loss of green and open spaces in the surrounding peri-urban areas, however, the compact growth scenarios characterized by high-density settlements have advantages over low-density scenarios in terms of overall surface runoff reduction at the city scale. Thus, the trade-off between the neighborhood and city scale should be considered when promoting nature-based solutions for surface runoff mitigation. Moreover, the approach presented here can be used as an effective planning tool supporting various urban contexts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Non-point sources of pollution, primarily agricultural drainage waters, can cause eutrophication and deterioration of water bodies. Surface flow constructed wetlands (SFCWs) are an ecological solution that can represent an efficient barrier and prevent agricultural pollutants from reaching other ecosystems. However, to better manage them and to understand removal processes occurring, it is important to study SFCWs that are functioning for longer periods of time and assess their efficiencies. This study concentrates on a full-scale SFCW in the Northern Italy that is used for agricultural drainage water treatment since the year 2000. An in-deep monitoring done for two years (2018 and 2019) showed that the system achieved satisfactory retention of up to 82% for TSS and up to 78% for TN and NO3 --N. TP retention seemed to be poor (-27%), but further analysis showed that the SFCW performed well in this aspect as well, and that it is important to include precipitation loads in the overall balance. Soil content of nutrients and different trace elements did not show considerable differences in respect to the beginning of the monitoring period, and the uptake rates of TN and TP by above-ground vegetation were in the range 19.0-26.3 and 1.6-2.1 g m-2, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Our theoretical model encompassing these factors and mechanisms and satisfactorily accounted for the variance in intention. In particular, our empirical results from the structural analysis verified the adequacy of the second-order structure of NBS that significantly increased guest mental health perception. In addition, our findings from the metric invariance test revealed that switching barriers significantly moderated the link from satisfaction to intention. The mediating effect of mental health perception and satisfaction was also uncovered. Moreover, the research hypotheses linking study variables were generally supported.

       " 'Dense grass covers are generally recommended for surface protection of sea dikes against mild and moderate hydraulic loads. The standard seeding mixtures were composed to meet the technical requirements and ensure dike safety. These mixtures are, however, limited in their species diversity. In the present study, four differently vegetated surfaces were tested regarding their erosion resistance against wave impacts and overflow. The test vegetations ranged from a species-poor grass-dominated reference mixture to species-rich herb-dominated mixtures. Two vegetations were reinforced with a three-dimensional geogrid. For the unreinforced vegetations, the erosion rate due to wave impacts decreased exponentially with increasing root density and root length density. The geogrid reinforcements functioned as additional protection when the upper vegetation layer was eroded and led to slightly decreasing erosion rate with depth. In overflow simulations, the relatively densely-vegetated grass-dominated mixture experienced least erosion. Erosion was mainly initiated at bare spots emphasizing the major role of a closed vegetation cover and dike maintenance. The present results give new insights into erosion patterns of unreinforced and reinforced vegetated dike covers and the relation between vegetation parameters and hydraulic resistance to wave impacts and overflow. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Changes in the urban landscape resulting from rapid urbanisation and climate change have the potential to increase land surface temperature (LST) and the incidence of the urban heat island (UHI). An increase in urban heat directly affects urban livelihoods and systems. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation of the UHI in the Kurunegala urban area (KUA) of North-Western Province, Sri Lanka. The KUA is one of the most intensively developing economic and administrative capitals in Sri Lanka with an urban system that is facing climate vulnerabilities and challenges of extreme heat conditions. We examined the UHI formation for the period 1996-2019 and its impact on the urban-systems by exploring nature-based solutions (NBS). This study used annual median temperatures based on Landsat data from 1996 to 2019 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Various geospatial approaches, including spectral index-based land use/cover mapping (1996, 2009 and 2019), urban-rural gradient zones, UHI profile, statistics and grid-based analysis, were used to analyse the data. The results revealed that the mean LST increased by 5.5 ◦C between 1996 and 2019 mainly associated with the expansion pattern of impervious surfaces. The mean LST had a positive correlation with impervious surfaces and a negative correlation with the green spaces in all the three time-points. Impacts due to climate change, including positive temperature and negative rainfall anomalies, contributed to the increase in LST. The study recommends interactively applying NBS to addressing the UHI impacts with effective mitigation and adaptation measures for urban sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Wooden fences are applied as a nature-based solution to support mangrove restoration along mangrove coasts in general and the Mekong Delta coast in particular. The simple structure uses vertical bamboo poles as a frame to store horizontal bamboo and tree branches (brushwood). Fence resistance is quantitatively determined by the drag coefficient exerted by the fence material on the flow; however, the behaviour of drag is predictable only when the arrangement of the cylinders is homogeneous. Therefore, for more arbitrary arrangements, the Darcy-Forchheimer equations need to be considered. In this study, the law of fluid flow was applied by forcing a constant flow of water through the fence material and measuring the loss of hydraulic pressure over a fence thickness. Fences, mainly using bamboo sticks, were installed with model-scale and full-scale diameters applying two main arrangements, inhomogeneous and staggered. Our empirical findings led to several conclusions. The bulk drag coefficient (CD) is influenced by the flow regime represented by Reynolds number. The drag coefficient decreases with the increase of the porosity, which strongly depends on fence arrangements. Finally, the Forchheimer coefficients can be linked to the drag coefficient through a related porosity parameter at high turbulent conditions. The staggered arrangement is well-predicted by the Ergun-relations for the Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients when an inhomogeneous arrangement with equal porosity and diameter leads to a large drag and flow resistance. © 2020 by the author.',\n",
       " 'Although it is commonly believed that trees can improve air quality, recent studies have shown that such pollution mitigation can be negligible – or that tree canopies can even increase pollutant concentrations near their sources compared to adjacent treeless areas. We explored the impacts of urban roadside forest patches on the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in summer and winter in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, and especially investigated if canopy cover can result in increased concentrations of NO2 below the canopy. Our results, however, did not show significantly higher – or lower – NO2 concentrations underneath tree canopies compared to levels above canopies. Neither did NO2 levels at the below-canopy sampling height differ significantly between forest patches and adjacent open, treeless areas. The lack of a canopy effect may derive from the rather small size of the forest patches, and – compared to previous studies with similar design – divergent tree species composition forming a dense canopy structure. Our results corroborate previous studies that the potential ecosystem services offered by urban near-road forests are more likely due to benefits other than those related to the removal of air pollutants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

This paper presents a conceptual framework of policy needs for analysing the science of nature-based solutions’ implementation and connect it to the practice of their implementation that advances the literature by connecting well-researched gaps to a more innovative action-oriented policy development approach that we argue is required for embedding scaled-up nature-based solutions. We conceptualise and ground the policy needs framework of skills, knowledge and partnerships theoretically in current literature of NBS policy and planning and empirically in three European case study cities: Genk in Belgium, Glasgow in UK and Poznan in Poland. The cross-case study analysis points to the knowledge needs of systems’ thinking and solutions-oriented thinking as paramount for implementing nature-based solutions. Our analysis further points to the skills’ needs of negotiation and collaboration for administrative silo bridging and for forging multi-sectoral partnerships essential for planning, and co-managing NBS. We conclude with three ways forward to addressing the policy needs for implementation: first, cities can invest in tailored and targeted capacity building programs, second, institutional spaces need to be established that allow for collaborative learning through and for partnerships and third, cities need to chart governance innovations that promote evidence-based policy for nature-based solutions’ design and implementation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

To increase the adaptive capacity of stormwater management systems, there is a shift towards decentralized nature-based solutions (NBS). Especially in densely built areas the availability of land can be a limiting factor for the implementation of NBS. To consider the spatial framework conditions in planning we developed an integrated modelling framework for prioritizing sites for NBS implementation for stormwater management within built urban structures. The implementation potential of NBS from a settlement structure model and a street typology model are combined with the discharge reduction potential from a sewer model. In effectiveness matrices priorities for stormwater management sites for individual NBS are identified.

       " \"The urban heat island effect creates warmer and drier conditions in urban areas than in their surrounding rural areas. This effect is predicted to be exacerbated in the future, under a climate change scenario. One way to mitigate this effect is to use the urban green infrastructure as a way to promote the cooling island effect. In this study we aimed to model, with a high spatial resolution, how Mediterranean urban parks can be maximized to be used as cooling islands, by answering the following questions: i) which factors influence the cooling effect and when?; ii) what type of green spaces contributes the most to the cooling effect?; iii) what is the cooling distance of influence? To answer these questions we established a sampling design where temperature and relative humidity were measured in different seasons, in locations with contrasting characteristics of green and grey cover. We were able to model the effect of green and grey spaces in the cooling island effect and build high spatial resolution predicting maps for temperature and relative humidity. Our study showed that even green spaces with reduced areas can regulate microclimate, alleviating temperature by 1–3 °C and increasing moisture by 2–8%, on average. Green spaces with a higher density of trees were more efficient in delivering the cooling effect. The morphology, aspect and level of exposure of grey surfaces to the solar radiation were also important features included in the models. Green spaces influenced temperature and relative humidity up to 60 m away from the parks' limits, whereas grey areas influenced in a much lesser range, from 5 m up to 10 m. These models can now be used by citizens and stakeholders for green spaces management and human well-being impact assessment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " \"Bhojtal, a large man-made lake bordering the city of Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh state, central India), is important for the city's water supply, connoted the lifeline of the city. Despite the dry though not arid and markedly seasonal climate, soil impermeability hampers infiltration into the complex geology underlying the Bhojtal catchment. Rural communities in the catchment are nonetheless high dependent on underlying aquifers. This paper develops baseline understanding of trends in the ecology, water quality and uses of Bhojtal, discussing their implications for the long-term wellbeing of the Bhopal city region. It highlights increasing dependency on water diverted from out-of-catchment sources, and also abstraction across the Bhojtal catchment in excess of replenishment that is depressing groundwater and contributing to reported declining lake level and water quality. Despite some nature-based management initiatives, evidence suggests little progress in haltering on-going groundwater depression and declines in lake water level and quality. Significant declines in ecosystem services produced by Bhojtal are likely without intervention, a major concern given the high dependency of people in the Bhopal region on Bhojtal for their water supply and socio-economic and cultural wellbeing. Over-reliance on appropriation of water from increasingly remote sources is currently compensating for lack of attention to measures protecting or regenerating local resources that may provide greater resilience and regional self-sufficiency. Improved knowledge of catchment hydrogeology on a highly localised scale could improve the targeting and efficiency of water harvesting and other management interventions in the Bhojtal catchment, and their appropriate hybridisation with engineered solutions, protecting the catchment from unintended impacts of water extraction or increasing its carrying capacity, and also providing resilience to rising population and climate change. Ecosystem service assessment provides useful insights into the breadth of benefits of improved management of Bhojtal and its catchment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'The presence and fate of microplastics (MPs) in wastewater represent a subject of major concern, as wastewater is one of the main inputs of MPs to the environment. This study deals with the ability of horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (CWs), as tertiary treatment, to reduce the MPs concentration of secondary effluents. Different locations of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) including raw wastewater, CW influent and final effluent, were sampled. Macroinvertebrates were collected from the CW to evaluate their potential role in the MPs distribution along the wetland. The global WWTP efficiency for MPs removal was 98%. MPs removal efficiency by CW was on average 88%, causing a significant reduction of the MPs concentration from 6.45 to 0.77 MP/L (p &lt; 0.05), thus preventing them from entering vulnerable aquatic systems. The areal removal rate and the first order areal rate coefficient (kA) were estimated to be 3120 MPs/m2/d and 1.70 m/d, respectively. The most abundant size fraction was the one comprising MPs between 75 and 425 μm (51%), while the other size ranges analysed (40–75 and 425–5600 μm) accounted for 25 and 24%, respectively. Fiber was the most abundant shape in the WWTP influent (75%), the CW influent (54%) and effluent (71%). Non-significant differences were found between sites regarding size and shape distributions (p &gt; 0.05). Macroinvertebrates can ingest a non-negligible quantity of MPs, with an average content of 166.2 MPs/g or 0.13 MPs/individual. Therefore, they could play a certain role in the MPs distribution inside CWs. Fiber was the most abundant shape for macroinvertebrates as well (89%), so attention should be paid to reduce their contamination at source. This study provides the first results on MPs removal in CWs as tertiary treatment and assesses the potential role of macroinvertebrates in their distribution along the CW, thus filling this gap of knowledge. © 2020',\n",

The topsoil, the richer layer in soil organic carbon and organic matter (OM), is affected by water erosion. Nature-based solutions appear as a suitable option for sustainable farming. In this study, the effectiveness of two years of CC management to reduce the OM loss is evaluated in a rainfed vineyard in a rolling landscape (Huesca, NE Spain). Two sediment traps collected runoff over 15 months. Topsoil OM contents (1.64% and 1.60%) and sediment/soil OM enrichment ratio (2.61 and 3.07) were similar. However, the average annual rate of OM loss was 3.6 times higher in the plot with lower vegetation cover than in the plot with CCs (1.29 vs. 0.35 kgOM ha-1 yr-1). The concentration of OMSed showed a negative relationship with the net soil loss; and significant differences appeared between the OMSed in the months with low and moderate-to-high ground cover. CCs are an excellent nature-based solution to control the unsustainable soil and OM losses measured in vineyards, which will contribute to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how nature-based solutions (NBS) are being used in city areas to improve environmental conditions and increase tourism. This research examines the drivers behind, and impacts of, the application of NBS in city redevelopment projects for tourism. NBS is a term that refers to the use of flora and fauna ecosystems as an approach to resolve problems faced by society. Design/methodology/approach: An interdisciplinary research methodology has been developed to examine the relationship between city NBS and tourism; the methods include a literature review of contemporary practice, field observations and thematic textual analysis from digital archives. The research methodology uses a combined empirical and desk-based analysis of five case studies cites. Findings: NBS, as part of city redevelopment projects, is now a strategic aim of many cities globally to re-brand, re-vision and re-orientate themselves to be more hospitable, liveable and attractive to tourists and visitors. Practical implications: City redevelopment projects are incorporating NBS to address climate change as well as local environmental issues such as disaster resilience whilst simultaneously delivering social and economic benefits. Social implications: The research reveals that NBS can deliver benefits to human wellbeing, tourism, economic vitality as well as more sustainable models of urban development. Originality/value: The research reveals for the first time how NBS is being used as a driver for increasing tourism globally. The research is highly original as it examines a new topic in tourism studies, the role of NBS in relation to city tourism. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.',\n",
       " 'This article contributes to the debate on water (re)socialisation by looking at contemporary Dutch flood management, which suggests a paradigm shift by giving land back to water: ontpoldering. Focusing on the case of the island Tiengemeten, a place «given back to nature» and water, we explore which actors define nature and how much space and time nature and water receive, as well as the implications of these processes for humans and non-humans. To understand these processes we propose the notion of naturification, analyzed in light of social, environmental and ecological justice theories. This brought us to the conclusion that awareness is needed for the side effects of this promising increase in ecological justice: the disruption of community fabric and a loss of diverse ways of defining and relating to nature and water.

       " \"A tension between a scientific «expert» knowledge and a «traditional» local knowledge has always crossed Disaster Risk Reduction policies and practices. Big detention basins or large engineering works are usually preferred by delegated agencies for flood risk mitigation measures based on scientific hydraulic models. Due to economic or geo-morphological reasons these solutions can't be always implemented, and so challenging «traditional» cost-benefit analysis. This was the case of a six-year project called Rural Sustainable Drainage System (RSUDS), led since 2014 by the local government of Stroud, a village in South West England. Following the 2007 major floods occurred in England, four action groups were formed in the study site to demand for further flood risk mitigation measures. Due to the inefficiency of the engineering solutions proposed, which consisted of two large ponds working as detention basins, the bottom-up process resulted in the implementation of nature-based solutions consisting also of dozens of different small ponds with different functions to prevent from flooding. The different actors were bearers of different kind of knowledges, which interacted at local level, driven by relationships between actors and between actors and water catchments. Situated relationships and practices activated and produced local knowledges, due to the role of water flowing in shaping risk and risk framing. In terms of lesson learned, this case study showed how considering local knowledge in flood risk framing and management can refer to the multiple functions of nature-based solutions and be a threshold for effectiveness. © 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

       " \"Research Highlights: This is the first review of existing knowledge on the Lamiaceae taxa of Greece, considering their distribution patterns and their linkage to the ecosystem services they may provide. Background and Objectives: While nature-based solutions are sought in many fields, the Lamiaceae family is well-known as an important ecosystem services provider. In Greece, this family counts 111 endemic taxa and the aim of the present study is to summarize their known occurrences, properties and chemical composition and analyze the correlations between these characteristics. Materials and Methods: After reviewing all available literature on the studied taxa, statistical and GIS spatial analyses were conducted. Results: The known properties of the endemic Lamiaceae taxa refer mostly to medicinal and antimicrobial ones, but also concern nutritional and environmental aspects. Essential oils compositions with high concentrations in molecules of interest (e.g., carvacrol, caryphyllene oxide, etc.) have been found in some taxa, suggesting unexploited applications for these taxa. Distribution patterns show a higher concentration of endemic Lamiaceae on the island of Kriti and southern Peloponnisos; patterns of the endemics' properties are also highlighted in the biodiversity hotspot of Kriti. However, the lack of data for two thirds of the taxa, regarding their properties or specific distribution, shows a gap of knowledge. Results on endemic Lamiaceae properties and composition are correlated with the supply or potential supply of ecosystem services and the relevant hotspots have been identified. Conclusions: The Greek endemic Lamiaceae taxa are proved to be of great importance, regarding their chemical composition and the properties they confer. The distribution analysis suggests the existence of clustering patterns of plant species with common properties. Finally, this study highlights knowledge gaps that should be filled in order to ensure the conservation of the endemic Lamiaceae taxa and the preservation of the ecosystem services they provide or could potentially provide. © 2020 by the authors.

       " 'Green infrastructure (GI) is a nature-based solution that encompasses all actions that rely on ecosystems and the services they provide to respond to various societal challenges such as climate change, food security or disaster risk. The objective of this work is to analyze the state of the art and latest trends in research on GI related to the water cycle for the period 2002-2019. For this purpose, a bibliometric study is carried out taking as reference the two most important scientific databases, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. The results show that, as of 2013, there is an exponential increase in the number of publications. This is due to the fact that significant regions of the planet, such as Europe, have adopted strategies aimed at promoting the use of GI since 2013. The keyword analysis points out that ecosystem services is the most relevant concept, which shows the capacity of these infrastructures to facilitate multiple goods and services related to the water cycle.

       " 'The increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events caused by the changing climate (e.g., cloudbursts, rainstorms, heavy rainfall, hail, heavy snow), combined with the high population density and concentration of assets, makes urban areas particularly vulnerable to pluvial flooding. Hence, assessing their vulnerability under current and future climate scenarios is of paramount importance. Detailed hydrologic-hydraulic numerical modeling is resource intensive and therefore scarcely suitable for performing consistent hazard assessments across large urban settlements. Given the steadily increasing availability of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) high-resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Models), several studies highlighted the potential of fast-processing DEM-based methods, such as the Hierarchical Filling-&-Spilling or Puddle-to-Puddle Dynamic Filling-&-Spilling Algorithms (abbreviated herein as HFSAs). We develop a fast-processing HFSA, named Safer_RAIN, that enables mapping of pluvial flooding in large urban areas by accounting for spatially distributed rainfall input and infiltration processes through a pixel-based Green-Ampt model. We present the first applications of the algorithm to two case studies in Northern Italy. Safer_RAIN output is compared against ground evidence and detailed output from a two-dimensional (2D) hydrologic and hydraulic numerical model (overall index of agreement between Safer_RAIN and 2D benchmark model: sensitivity and specificity up to 71% and 99%, respectively), highlighting potential and limitations of the proposed algorithm for identifying pluvial flood-hazard hotspots across large urban environments. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'In recent years, there has been a surge in research with respect to urban regeneration worldwide. Urban regeneration is usually regarded as a path for economic growth through the reconstruction of dilapidated urban areas in cities. Nevertheless, a cluster of factors, including those with respect to the environment, economy, society, and culture, influences urban regeneration. Furthermore, genuinely effective and sustainable regeneration processes should be progrowth on all fronts. Few existing studies explicitly interpret which features that regeneration projects reflecting inclusion should have and how to implement the urban regeneration. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of inclusive urban regeneration combining nature-based solutions (NbS) with society-based solutions (SbS). And its connotation and features, as well as content and objectives, are clearly elaborated. In addition, this paper explains how to carry out inclusive urban regeneration from two aspects of spatial planning and social construction. In order to ensure its implementation for possible difficulties, the guarantee mechanism is also highlighted. This paper can be used as a theoretical guide for subsequent urban regeneration. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.',\n",
       " 'Many cities are growing and becoming more densely populated, resulting in land use changes, which promotes an increase in urban heating. Nature-based solutions (NBS) are considered sustainable, cost-effective and multi-purpose solutions for these problems. While various studies assess the effects of NBS on urban heat or urban sprawl/compaction, no studies assess their cumulative effect. The main objective of this study is to assess the short-term and medium- to long-term impacts of NBS on urban heat fluxes, taking as a case study the city of Eindhoven in The Netherlands. An integrated modelling approach, composed of a coupled meteorological and urban energy balance model (WRF-SUEWS) and an hedonic pricing simulation model (SULD), is used to assess urban heat fluxes and urban compaction effects, respectively. Results show that, in the short-term, NBS have a local cooling effect due to an increase in green/blue spaces and, in the medium to long-term, an urban compaction effect due to attraction of residents from peripheral areas to areas surrounding attractive NBS. This study provides evidence that NBS can be used to reduce the effects of urban heating and urban sprawl and that an integrated modelling approach allows to better understand its overalleffects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Offering remarkable biodiversity, coastal salt marshes also provide a wide variety of ecosystem services: cultural services (leisure, tourist amenities), supply services (crop production, pastoralism) and regulation services including carbon sequestration and natural protection against coastal erosion and inundation. The consideration of this coastal protection ecosystem service takes part in a renewed vision of coastal risk management and especially marine flooding, with an emerging focus on “nature-based solutions.” Through this work, using remote-sensing methods, we propose a novel drone-based spatial modeling methodology of the salt marsh hydrodynamic attenuation at very high spatial resolution (VHSR). This indirect modeling is based on in situ measurements of significant wave heights (Hm0 ) that constitute the ground truth, as well as spectral and topographical predictors from VHSR multispectral drone imagery. By using simple and multiple linear regressions, we identify the contribution of predictors, taken individually, and jointly. The best individual drone-based predictor is the green waveband. Dealing with the addition of individual predictors to the red-green-blue (RGB) model, the highest gain is observed with the red edge waveband, followed by the near-infrared, then the digital surface model. The best full combination is the RGB enhanced by the red edge and the normalized difference vegetation index (coefficient of determination (R2 ): 0.85, root mean square error (RMSE): 0.20%/m). © 2020 by the authors.

The research focuses on policies of three neighbouring local governments in Melbourne Australia, representing inner, middle and outer urban contexts. The paper applies Transition Management's four spheres, strategic, tactical, operational and reflexive, to structure the analysis. The research identified key policy success factors and related these to the four spheres of analysis. The research found that a key limitation to a consistent or unified approach to green space provision is the ‘splintered’ or competing narratives that are applied to the functions, benefits and characteristics of urban green spaces.

       " 'Nature Based Solutions (NBS) for urban water management seek to harness natural processes and (re) connect diverse flows in the urban water cycle for increased ecological sustainability. Developed in Australia, the US and Europe, the application of these approaches for urban water management tends to focus primarily on improving the environmental sustainability of grey water infrastructure. In many Asian cities, where the coverage of existing grey infrastructure is partial, and in some cases declining, the applicability of such approaches seems limited. That said, an engagement between NBS and the urban water challenges of Asian cities offers good reasons to expand NBS to address conditions of water vulnerability. In this Viewpoint, we take a particular interest in how NBS principles related to natural processes and alternative water supplies might be directed toward mitigating environmental harm in circumstances where urban residents are already reliant on non-networked and ‘natural’ services for water supply. We argue that improving infrastructure for sustainability in such cases requires thinking about how to limit the impacts of infrastructure inequalities on vulnerable residents and providing low-cost innovations that can work to protect and stabilise the non-networked ecological services on which millions of urban residents already depend. © 2020 Liverpool University Press.

       " 'Transitions literature regards technologies as critical components in shifting systems towards sustainability, which has informed the development of the technology-oriented Technological Innovation System (TIS) framework. The emerging discourse on nature-based solutions (NBS) – multifunctional nature-integrated spatial planning and design innovations – raises the question to what extent TIS can account for the development and diffusion of NBS. Following a literature review, we present the Nature-Based Innovation System (NBIS) framework delineating critical factors for urban nature-based innovation. We find both commonalities and differences between TIS and NBIS, suggesting that the roles of place-based dynamics, agency and governance structure are more central to nature-based innovation, and market formation is more central to technological innovation. This has implications for the study of sustainability transitions, which has likely underplayed the potential of innovations at the nexus of socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. Future research is needed to refine the NBIS framework, for example by studying evolutionary developmental trajectories. © 2019 The Authors',\n",

International organizations such as the United Nations and the European Commission are highlighting the potential role of nature in mitigating air pollution and are now funding the implementation of Nature-Based Solutions, especially at the city level. Over the past few decades, the attention of the scientific community has grown around the role of urban forest in air pollution mitigation. Nevertheless, the understanding on Particulate Matter (PM) retention mechanisms by tree leaves is still limited. In this study, twelve tree species were sampled within an urban park of an industrial city. Two techniques were used for leaf analysis: Vacuum/Filtration and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, in order to obtain a quali-quantitative analysis of the different PM size fractions. Results showed that deposited PM loads vary significantly among species. Different leaf traits, including micro and macromorphological characteristics, were observed, measured and ranked, with the final aim to relate them with PM load. Even if no significant correlation between each single leaf characteristic and PM deposition was observed (p > 0.05), multivariate analysis revealed relationships between clusters of leaf traits and deposited PM. Thus, by assigning a score to each trait, an Accumulation index (Ai) was calculated, which was significantly related to the leaf deposited PM load (p ≤ 0.05). © 2018',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions are becoming an increasingly important component of sustainable coastal risk management. For particularly destructive hazards like tsunamis, natural elements like vegetation are often combined with designed elements like seawalls or dams to augment the protective benefits of each component. One example of this kind of hybrid approach is the so-called tsunami mitigation park, which combines a designed hillscape with vegetation. Despite the increasing popularity of tsunami mitigation parks, the protective benefits they provide are poorly understood and incompletely quantified. As a consequence of this lack of understanding, current designs might not maximize the protective benefits of tsunami mitigation parks. Here, we numerically model the interactions between a single row of hills with an incoming tsunami to identify the mechanisms through which the park protects the coast. We initialize the tsunami as an N wave that propagates to shore and impacts the coast directly. We find that partial reflection of the incoming wave is the most important mechanism by which hills reduce the kinetic energy that propagates onshore. The protective benefit of tsunami mitigation parks is thus comparable to that of a small wall, at least for tsunamis with amplitudes that are comparable to the hill height. We also show that hills could elevate potential damage in the immediate vicinity of the hills where flow speeds increase compared to a planar beach, suggesting the need to include a buffer zone behind the hills into a strategic park design. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

       " 'Nature-based solutions directed at improving biodiversity, on both public and private land, can provide multiple benefits, but many of these benefits are not being fully realised. One reason is the normative and cognitive disconnect between people and nature, highlighting the need for new learning programs to foster better nature connections. More is known about learning in the context of community gardens than in relation to private gardens. Using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, this study explores learning among residents engaged in home gardening for biodiversity in Winnipeg, Canada. We uncovered diverse and interconnected learning processes/activities founded on formative childhood experiences. The processes/activities were non-formal and informal, and included individual, social and blended experiences. Learning outcomes were also mutually influencing and multi-levelled, comprising normative, cognitive/behavioural and relational changes. The results support an analytical framework suggesting how learning-focused initiatives can enhance biodiversity on private property and aid in delivery of nature-based solutions. © 2019, © 2019 Newcastle University.',\n",
       " \"Cities have become major contributors to sustainability problems and, in the meantime, seedbeds for sustainability transformation. Urban nature-based solutions, such as greening strategies that foster urban food production as a cross-cutting issue, promise to have multidimensional benefits for sustainable urban development. However, a conceptual understanding of interlinkages between nature-based solutions and their contribution to sustainability transformation is lacking. The goals of this study are twofold. First, to develop a conceptual model for testing multi-dimensional impacts of urban nature-based solutions supporting social-spatial, social-ecological and individual sustainable transformation. The model has been developed based on the concepts of place attachment, human-food connection and pro-environmental food behaviour. Second, the conceptual model is applied to the example of edible cities. Edible cities can be considered an innovative nature-based solution that provides multiple co-benefits by offering (free) food for urban residents in public spaces. A Principal Component Analysis of a survey among residents of Andernach (N = 380), one of the first edible cities in Germany revealed, in contrast to the conceptual three-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model with high construct validity and reliability. The model comprises a) place attachment, b) experiential and c) material human-food connection as well as d) pro-environmental food consumption. Items of internal emotional and philosophical human-food connection included within the pro-environmental food consumption scale suggested their important role in fostering sustainability. Results suggest that the edible city can be considered a strategy for increasing urban attractiveness and place identity, supporting social bonding and experiential human-food connection by using the edible areas for nature observation and recreation. However, although the residents are well informed about the edible city concept, most residents are not actively involved and rarely use the food provided by the edible city. Thus, they also could not answer questions related to cognitive human-food connection such as estimating the food's taste and health quality. To strengthen material and cognitive human-food connection, policy implications of the results propose the implementation of accompanying information and participation activities. By linking nature-based solutions with sustainability transformation, this study provides conceptual and practical implications for the multidimensional benefits of innovative urban greening strategies such as edible cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'The role of the urban common (i.e. shared space and resources) in sustainable provisioning of goods and services to city dwellers is discussed in this paper. Focusing on tree-based green infrastructure, the study scope includes three categories of provisioning (woody biomass, food/fibre, and non-timber forest products, i.e. NTFPs), alongside three categories of supporting services (fresh water replenishment, soil nutrient restoration, building preservation). As a first step, prospects of utilizing the urban common as facilitator of nature-based solution to the earmarked provisioning services are evaluated through dedicated literature survey and expert elicitation on perceived impact of environmental change triggers and management interventions (planning and/or governance). This is followed by a structured review of the state of affairs in four European cities (London, Amsterdam, Sofia, Ljubljana), representing different macro-geographical regions with distinct socio-economic drivers in managing these provisioning services. The pan-European expert elicitation exercise noted active management of the urban common as positively impacting on the performance of the majority of provisioning services, while environmental change impacts were found to be overriding and adversely influencing the provisioning of material resources (mainly NTFPs and woody biomass). The four-city case study highlighted some regional peculiarities in connecting the city dwellers to the urban common and identified the need to overcome socio-cultural barriers for enhancing pan-European best practice sharing in the management of goods and services provisioning. This is deemed essential to pave way for an emerging perspective on sustainable utilization of the urban common as an enabler for nature-based solution, making it fit for purpose in meeting the astronomical demands of future urban living. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'Hydrological catchments today are largely the product of human activity. They have been engineered. The negative impacts of some of this engineering such as deforestation and agriculture intensification need to be addressed but the solution is not simply a matter of doing the opposite, for example through afforestation or moving to less-intensive farming. We propose a catchment systems engineering (CSE) approach that utilizes and expands on existing catchment-based approaches, combining interventions that work with or mimic natural processes with traditional “hard” engineering to provide a practical route to improved catchment function. The approach is predicated on the need to take an holistic view of catchments and to make proactive interventions that provide and enhance multiple ecosystem services. CSE seeks to address problems that are international in scope, recognizing the need to understand better how hydrological processes have changed due to human activity and how those changes influence frequency, duration, and severity of environmental problems such as floods, droughts, and poor water quality. The emphasis is placed on how we can act to engineer catchment systems to a safer functionally appropriate level utilizing measures such as nature-based solutions alongside traditional engineering structures. CSE is the means to provide multiple ecosystem services while recognizing trade-offs between reducing flood and drought risk directly, improving water quality and creating healthy habitats for wildlife. By targeting local hydrological flow pathways in defined spatial and temporal windows (e.g., during rainfall events at key locations such as riparian zones), CSE can deliver holistic water resource management now.

       " 'The nature-based concept of the Sandbar Breakwater was born based on the typical natural dynamics of the West African coast (Gulf of Guinea). Learning from the development and coastal impact of the existing port infrastructure in West Africa, the application of sand as a construction material for marine infrastructure seemed very obvious. Along this coast, ports experience heavy sedimentation at the western updrift side of the breakwaters, leading to the rapid burying of valuable armour rock. The Sandbar Breakwater concept is based on this principle by using natural accretion as the basis for the port protection. Such a concept is advantageous as a large sediment drift naturally supplements the sand filling works during construction and the required rock volumes are reduced significantly, saving construction time and minimising the environmental impact. To counteract the downdrift coastal retreat, a replenishable sand engine completes the scheme. The realisation of a Sandbar Breakwater at Lekki, Nigeria, in 2018, with subsequent safe and continuous port operations, proves the feasibility of the concept. Sustainable future development is further pursued by integrated maintenance campaigns following the Building with Nature principles to guarantee the operability of the port while preserving the alongshore sediment balance and minimising the environmental impact. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",

While several papers document the reliability of such infrastructures in providing a variety of water-related services, few studies investigated the actual behaviour and the attitude of different stakeholders to understand the limitations and barriers inWrGIs/SuDSs implementation. In this paper, we investigated these issues by posing a set of questions to 71 qualified stakeholders in three Italian regions (Toscana, Liguria, and Sardegna) and one French region (Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur) in the northwestern Mediterranean. The results of the investigation largely show a lack of knowledge on these innovative solutions, although there is a general interest in their implementation both in the Italian and French regions. Barriers are also constituted by the scarcity of the demonstrators implemented, little knowledge on construction and maintenance costs, the absence of a proper regulatory framework, and of fiscal and financial incentives to support private citizens and companies. We finally suggest tools and soft measures that, in our opinion, may contribute to supporting the implementation of WrGIs/SuDSs, especially in view of adapting Mediterranean territories to the challenges posed by climate change. The results of our analyses may be reasonably up-scaled to the whole Mediterranean coastal region. © 2020 by the authors.\",\n",

ClimateCafe Malmo evaluated these NBS with 20 young professionals from nine nationalities and seven disciplines with a variety of practical tools. In two days, 175 NBS were mapped and categorised in Malmo. Results show that the selected green infrastructure have a satisfactory infiltration capacity and low values of potential toxic element pollutants after 20 years in operation. The question \"Is capacity building achieved by interdisciplinary field experience related to climate change adaptation?\" was answered by interviews, collecting data of water quality, pollution, NBS and heat stress mapping, and measuring infiltration rates, followed by discussion. The interdisciplinary workshops with practical tools provide a tangible value to the participants and are needed to advance sustainability efforts. Long term lessons learnt from Augustenborg will help stormwater managers within planning of NBS.

Many extractive companies are now aware of their impacts and, while pressured by society, demand concrete solutions from researchers to reverse the effects of exploitation and restore biodiversity and ecosystems services. In this article, we compile and synthesize the contributions of the latest available research on quarry restoration. We depict and discuss some of the most pressing issues regarding (1) the challenges of restoring quarries; (2) the opportunities for biodiversity and ecosystem services delivery; and (3) outline further research addressing current gaps. We conclude that quarries pose different abiotic and biotic constraints that act interdependently, hampering the attainment of effective restoration if considered solely. Such constraints need to be addressed holistically to lastly encourage the self-sustainability of the system by reinstating ecological processes. However, a restored site does not have to specifically mimic the pristine situation, as under certain conditions alternative approaches may uphold valuable natural assets contributing to the conservation of rare, restricted, or protected species and habitats. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration',\n",
       " \"Green walls (GWs) have been increasingly recognized as an important restoration technique for steep slopes resulting from quarrying activities or major infrastructure construction projects. In practice, GW irrigation is considered essential, although studies evaluating vegetation establishment under different irrigation regimes are lacking. Besides taxonomic metrics, functional diversity measures were used to compare the diversity and composition of plant communities of two hydroseeded GWs, with different irrigation regimes (irrigated vs. low-irrigated). The studied GWs were installed in Peneda-Gerês National Park (NW Portugal) to minimize the visual impact of shotcrete walls, along a road infrastructure, and promote their ecological restoration. Species' cover was recorded 3 years after installation. Species were classified according to their growth form, life form, and life strategy. Despite hydroseeding approximately 57 species, GW vegetation was dominated by spontaneous species, particularly acrocarpous mosses, regardless of irrigation regime. Species and functional richness were higher under irrigated conditions, while no differences were observed for species diversity and functional dispersion. Functional trait composition did not differ between GWs, indicating that both systems potentially provide the same ecosystem functions and services. Our results also suggest that spontaneous species colonizing GWs are highly adapted to local environmental conditions, given their dominance in both irrigated and low-irrigated communities. Overall, irrigation did not affect the structure and functioning of GW communities, only their redundancy, since more species exhibiting similar traits were established in the irrigated GW. Therefore, our findings suggest that low-irrigated GWs, hydroseeded with native species, represent a\\xa0more cost-effective solution to reduce the ecological impacts of steep slopes. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration\",\n",
       " 'Many cities face a struggle to reconcile ambitious tree canopy cover targets with urban development pressures. Canopy cover in The City of Melbourne, Australia, which has a target of 40 % canopy cover on public land by 2040, was analysed together with individual tree removal data, with particular focus on how many street trees were removed near major development sites between 2008 and 2017. We observed major gains and losses of canopy, resulting in small net changes. Our analyses showed a net gain in tree canopy cover in public streets and a net loss of canopy cover in public parks and private properties. The most frequently removed trees in both public parks and streets were small (<15 cm stem diameter). In contrast, more large, exotic trees were removed from public parks than public streetscapes. These large park trees represented a small proportion of total tree removals, but had larger stem basal areas and therefore large canopies. From 2008 to 2017, almost 2000 street trees were removed within 10 m of major development sites, equivalent to almost 20 % of all street trees removed in that time period, but this constituted only 8% of streetscape tree canopy cover losses. These findings suggest that in The City of Melbourne, mature tree succession and removal in parks has the greatest potential to hinder the achievement of canopy cover targets. Canopy cover gains could be maximised through improvements in the establishment and survival of replacement trees in both parks and streetscapes. The protection of the existing urban forest, through policy and practice, will also be critical for the retention and enhancement of tree canopy cover. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

To determine the sorption capacity of NH4 +, batch tests were performed using an amendment/SWW ratio of 1:20 and an NH4 + initial concentration ranging from 30 to 600 mg L−1. Results from the infiltration experiments show a high attenuation (~95%) of total phosphorous (TP) independently of the amendments. Different behaviour is observed for total nitrogen (TN). The removal of this species is obtained only in the soil amended with woodchips (&gt;85%) whereas the natural soil alone and the soil with biochar have no impact on TN attenuation. In these two porous media, all the NH4 + input concentration is transformed to NO3 − that infiltrates without further reactions. According to batch experiment results, the potential role of biochar in the nutrient attenuation is limited to sorption processes (Kd (NH4 +) = 21.37–193.18 L kg−1). Woodchips act primarily as a labile source of carbon promoting biodegradation, being more effective for nutrient attenuation than the sorption capacity of biochar. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'The use of stormwater biofilters (also known as bioretention systems and raingardens), in tropical and semi-arid areas is hindered by seasonal rainfall patterns which cause extended dry periods. These periods can result in plant die-off, long-term damage to system health and leaching of pollutants when stormwater inflows resume. Using an additional polluted water source during dry periods could minimise system stress and eliminate the need to irrigate biofilters with potable water during dry spells. As such, the presented laboratory study tested the seasonal operation of biofilters, by switching from stormwater treatment in wet months to greywater treatment in dry months. Forty-five single planted biofilter columns, incorporating sedges, grasses, understory ornamentals and vines, were subjected to four months of stormwater inflows, followed by three months of greywater inflows. We also investigated the impact of including a carbon source in the saturated zone on treatment performance. The results showed plant species selection to be critical for nitrogen and phosphorus removal, with consistently effective species such as Carex appressa and Canna x generalis able to maintain low outflow concentrations (e.g. total nitrogen of 0.2–0.3 mg/L and 0.3–0.6 mg/L, respectively) across both water sources. Low outflow phosphorus concentrations were associated with plant species that had high filterable reactive phosphorus removal across both water sources. Similarly, higher removal of ammonia and oxidised nitrogen was associated with lower overall nitrogen concentrations. In contrast, high removal of total suspended sediment (>94%), biochemical oxygen demand (>98%) and some heavy metals (e.g. lead >98% and copper >93%) was reported across all designs. The results suggest that with the careful selection of plant species, biofilters can be operated seasonally as a feasible and practical solution to maintaining system health during extended dry periods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions applied to the building skin, such as green roofs and vertical greenery systems, are standing out as the most promising by contributing with thermal improvements at building scale. From previous research done by GREiA research group at the University of Lleida (Spain), energy savings up to 58% were obtained by implementing vertical greenery systems on external building walls for cooling purposes. However, since there exist other passive and active energy saving technologies in the literature review that were limited their cooling and heating capacity after implementing internal heat loads, new experimental tests for two different vertical greenery systems simulating the heat loads in both, summer and winter were conducted in this research. Additionally, these experiments also improve the scarce and controversial literature for winter conditions. The results demonstrated that considering internal loads in experimental investigations is crucial for the results of the effectiveness of the green walls and green facades. The energy savings of VGS were reduced between 22.5% and 26.7% because of the internal loads for cooling purposes, and increased about 3.6% and 3.1% for heating. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Urban metabolism studies have gained momentum in recent years as a means to assess the environmental performance of cities and to point to more resource-efficient strategies for urban development. Recent literature reviews report a growing number of applications of the industrial ecology model for material flow analysis in the design of the built environment. However, applications of material flow analysis in green infrastructure development are scarce. In this article, we argue that: (i) the use of material flow analysis in green infrastructure practice can inform decision-making towards more resource-efficient urban planning; (ii) the ecosystem service concept is critical to operationalize material flow analysis for green infrastructure planning and design, and, through this, can enhance the impact of urban metabolism research on policy making and planning practice. The article draws from a systematic review of literature on urban ecosystem services and benefits provided by green infrastructure in urban regions. The review focuses on ecosystem services that can contribute to a more energy-efficient and less carbon-intensive urban metabolism. Using the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services as a baseline, we then discuss opportunities for integrating energy provision and climate regulation ecosystem services in material flow analysis. Our discussion demonstrates that the accounting of ecosystem services in material flow analysis enables expressing impacts of green infrastructure on the urban energy mix (renewable energy provision), the magnitude of energy use (mitigation of building energy demand) and the dynamics of biogeochemical processes in cities (carbon sequestration). We finally propose an expanded model for material flow analysis that illustrates a way forward to integrate the ecosystem service concept in urban metabolism models and to enable their application in green infrastructure planning and design. © The Author(s) 2018.',\n",
       " 'Alluvial aquifers in seasonal rivers are a yet underutilised resource in many (semi-)arid regions of Africa. These so-called sand river aquifers provide nature-based water storage within easy reach because they are shallow. They form a significant potential renewable source of water for irrigation development. Innovative approaches and solutions are needed to sustainably increase productive use of this resource to enhance rural livelihoods. The A4Labs action research explores the potential and pitfalls of introducing solutions designed for individual smallholder farmers. This entails innovation in three domains: the technology used (manually-installed shallow well-points in or next to a sand river combined with solar-powered water pumps), the arrangement (individual smallholder farmers), and the purpose (market-oriented farming). Pilots were established in the Limpopo river basin in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Monitoring and assessment are ongoing, but preliminary findings indicate that successful adoption of the approach was not constrained by water availability. Despite the fact that these pilots were established during two subsequent drought years, there was no difficulty in accessing freshwater in sufficient quantity. Instead, successful adoption depends on previous farming experience, market access, and the possibility to grow adaptively in terms of technology, scale and financial risks. In addition, establishing an individual farm to grow cash crops requires acceptance and new skills, as irrigation for smallholder farmers in Africa has traditionally been framed as a communal activity in “collective” irrigation schemes with strong support by outside agencies, and with the well-known collective action challenges. This action research has also estimated that the potential for upscaling this innovation in the Limpopo river basin is significant. Our innovative solution for accessing water stored in shallow alluvial aquifers can start small, is within reach of smallholder farmers (initial investment being less than US$1,000/0.2 ha), and is scalable as farmers can gradually improve their system and expand. Moreover, the solution allows for the application of “adaptive development pathways” at the river-stretch scale. © 2020',\n",
       " 'New York City’s coastlines are a mosaic of natural and man-made habitats intermixed with housing and industry, all of which are extremely vulnerable to flooding, storm surge, and damaging wave action. Risks are projected to increase over time as sea levels rise, population grows, and the frequency and severity of extreme events increase. This paper investigates the potential role of green infrastructure (GI) as a risk reduction measure, using Hurricane Sandy as a case study. Specifically, this research examines whether the type, size, and configuration of GI played a role in determining the odds of building damages. Results suggest that proximity to different GI types did affect the odds of damage, both positively and negatively, and that the impacts of both small-scale and large-scale natural features varied geographically. Results suggest that nature-based solutions to coastal flooding must be tailored to specific local conditions in order to be effective. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
       " 'The expansion of livestock industry resulted to larger waste production and pollutant deposition in the natural environment. Advanced treatment systems for treating wastewater and discharges from livestock areas are necessary to reduce the pollutant loads in receiving water bodies. This study mainly focused on evaluating the effectiveness of a livestock constructed wetland in treating composite wastewater discharge and stormwater runoff. Water and sediment samples were collected and analyzed to determine the factors that can potentially affect the performance of the facility. Positive pollutant removal performances for turbidity (52% to 81%), TSS (61 to 82%), organics (34% to 50%), and nutrients (10% to 48%) were noted in the CW for storm events and dry days due to the continuity of flow and adequate HRT conducive to pollutant removal. SLR models for pollutant removal efficiency yielded low r2 values (0.26 to 0.53) and high errors (6.85% to 31.45%) implied that the predictive removal efficiencies were not precise. Despite the significant decrease (p &lt;.05) in pollutant concentrations after the treatment, water quality standards were still exceeded by the effluent from the CW. Further improvements in the design of CWs can be incorporated to achieve the desired water quality standards. The findings of this inquiry can be used to establish the factors affecting the treatment performance of CWs and formulate design guidelines to improve the treatment process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'The high water level and extreme waves that occur during a storm may threaten coastal landscapes, including densely populated zones that may also suffer from erosion, increasing the flooding magnitude and the total risk level. Climate change and future sea-level rise may result in an increased impact of storms due to the changes in the frequency and/or magnitude of the extremes of these water levels and/or waves. Coastal dunes and their associated vegetation communities act as a barrier to storm surges and wind waves, reducing flooding and coastal erosion. Therefore, nature-based solutions to protect coastal areas have gained attention in the last years. This contribution aims at evaluating the effectiveness of dune system rehabilitation as a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measure under the current and future sea level scenarios at a rapidly eroding coastline in Bellocchio (Italy, Northern Adriatic Sea). The design of the dune reconstruction and revegetation was performed according to the morphodynamics and ecosystem characteristics of the current dune system. The effectiveness of the DRR was assessed based on numerical tests. The hydro-morphodynamic model XBeach reproduced morphological changes and inundation caused by a recent extreme event. The proposed DRR results in an increase of 22% of the sediment budget of the dune-beach system under the current sea level, and of the 57% and 82% under future sea level rise, for low and high hazard scenarios, respectively. The maximum water volume of the flooding is reduced by 42% in the current sea level. The expected increase of maximum flooding water volume under future high hazard and low hazard scenarios is reduced of 25% and 59%, respectively. These benefits are discussed along with a simplified cost analysis. It is concluded that the complete rehabilitation (reconstruction and revegetation) of the dune system represents a proper Disaster Reduction Solution under current and future sea level rise scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly recognized as a valid alternative to grey infrastructures - i.e. hard, human-engineered structures – as measures for reducing climate-related risks. Increasing evidences demonstrated that NBS can reduce risks to people and property as effectively as traditional grey infrastructures, but potentially offering many additional benefits, e.g. improving the natural habitat for wildlife, enhancing water and air quality, improving socio-cultural conditions of communities. The growing attention on the NBS, triggered an increasing interest in developing integrated and multi-disciplinary frameworks for assessing NBS effectiveness accounting for the co-benefits production. Starting from the analysis of the existing frameworks, this work claims for a more direct engagement of stakeholders – i.e. co-benefits beneficiaries – in developing NBS assessment framework. This work aims at demonstrating that differences in co-benefits perception and valuation might lead to trade-offs and, thus, to potential conflicts. An innovative methodology using a quasi-dynamic Fuzzy Cognitive Map approach based on multiple-time-steps was developed in order to assess NBS effectiveness, and to detect and analyze trade-offs among stakeholders due to differences in co-benefits perception. The developed methodology was implemented in the Lower Danube case study. The trade-off analysis among stakeholders shows that they are quite low in the short term. Most of the potential conflicts can be detected in the long term, involving mainly the stakeholders that assigned a high value to the agricultural productivity variable. The results demonstrated that accounting for the different stakeholders' perception of the co-benefits is key for reducing trade-offs and enhance NBS acceptability. © 2020 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Wetlands are among the crucial nature based solutions for river water purification. The ecological quality of these multi-purposed ecosystems could be disrupted due to overloading of nutrients and other pollutants. We investigated the water purifying efficiency and ecological quality of three natural riverine wetlands located in urban area in southern Ethiopia. Of the three wetlands, Boye wetland is located in a densely populated area with intensive human activity, and the other two, Fisho and Kitto located in a relatively less populated area of Jimma town. We sampled water, macroinvertebrates, and diatoms, to compare sites before joining the wetland, within the wetland and after passing through the wetland. Considering both seasons, up to 74% TP, 73% DIN, and 77% BOD reduction was recorded. The lower concentration of nutrients, and BOD in sites after joining the wetland showed the presence of pollution attenuation. Macroinvertebrate and diatom based bio-indices depicted higher biodiversity and lower relative abundance of tolerant taxa in sites after joining the wetland, which implied the potential of studied wetlands to reduce pollutants and sustain biodiversity. The incoming streams of Boye showed bad water quality and heavily degraded ecological status (Ethbios score 8–10). Most of the sites associated with Boye wetland depicted a major ecological disturbance (Ethbios score < 44). The incoming streams of Fisho revealed moderate (Ethbios score = 58) and poor (Ethbios score = 20) water quality. Most of Fisho sites had a moderate water quality with significant ecological disturbance. Sites associated with Kitto wetland, had a slight ecological disturbance (Ethbios score of 93 and 72) and some with significant ecological disturbance (Ethbios index score between 45 and 59). The wetland fed by heavily polluted streams showed the most degraded ecological quality compared to the other two that are fed by less polluted streams. An RDA model visualized pollution gradient among sites. Generally, this study confirmed the potential of natural wetlands to mitigate nutrients and organic pollutants and sustain biodiversity. However, when the incoming water is heavily degraded, the retention of pollutants seriously affect the wetland’s ecological quality. © Copyright © 2020 Sileshi, Awoke, Beyene, Stiers and Triest.',\n",
       " 'One of the central, flagship actions of the Resilient Melbourne Strategy has been the development of a metropolitan urban forest strategy, called ‘Living Melbourne’. Its explicitly metropolitan scope has been one of the distinct features of Resilient Melbourne, established through the global city network 100 Resilient Cities, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. It is an Australian first–a metropolitan strategy galvanising support for a unified vision for urban greening across the plethora of local governments, state government, water authorities, statutory planning agencies as well as various non-governmental organisations. This policy commentary interrogates and reflects on the development of this strategy in-the-making as an instance of metropolitan governance in action. Rather than being subjected to the paralysing partisan politics of formalised metropolitan governance, it casts metropolitan governance in Melbourne into a new perspective that is driven and framed as a thematically led initiative around urban-greening and nature-based solutions. In particular, the commentary will focus on the question of agency and policy innovation in metropolitan governance through examining policy levers of a thematically led initiative of ‘Living Melbourne’, the activation and collaboration in global city networks and the valorisation of knowledge-driven alliances locally and globally. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
       " 'As Australian cities face challenges of increased size, density and a range of environmental issues, compounded by climate change impacts, integration of greening is receiving increased attention. Greening, in the form of parks, gardens, waterways, water-sensitive designs and green roofs, contributes to liveability, sustainability and resilience, and habitat for non-human species. Local governments are responsible for the day-to-day management of much of Australia’s urban public spaces and are developing strategies for these areas. However, local-scale planning risks piecemeal, uncoordinated and ineffective approaches, particularly for biophysical systems that have little relationship with municipal boundaries. How can a metropolitan-scale approach be applied to green space planning and governance? This paper presents a case study of Living Melbourne metropolitan urban forest strategy, developed by Nature Conservancy and Resilient Melbourne. Resilient Melbourne brings together Melbourne’s 32 local governments to plan and advocate at the metropolitan scale. While the Living Melbourne strategy provides a metropolitan-scale approach, questions of governance, including how the strategy will be implemented and how local context is understood, are highlighted. Further, in developing a metropolitan-scale approach, how are the voices of local communities included?

       " 'Developing a general, predictive understanding of ecological systems requires knowing how much structural and functional relationships can cross scales and contexts. Here, we introduce the CROSSLINK project that investigates the role of forested riparian buffers in modified European landscapes by measuring a wide range of ecosystem attributes in stream-riparian networks. CROSSLINK involves replicated field measurements in four case-study basins with varying levels of human development: Norway (Oslo Fjord), Sweden (Lake Mälaren), Belgium (Zwalm River), and Romania (Argeş River). Nested within these case-study basins include multiple, independent stream-site pairs with a forested riparian buffer and unbuffered section located upstream, as well as headwater and downstream sites to show cumulative land-use impacts. CROSSLINK applies existing and bespoke methods to describe habitat conditions, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Here, we summarize the approaches used, detail protocols in supplementary materials, and explain how data is applied in an optimization framework to better manage tradeoffs in multifunctional landscapes. We then present results demonstrating the range of riparian conditions present in our case-study basins and how these environmental states influence stream ecological integrity with the commonly used macroinvertebrate Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index. We demonstrate that a qualitative index of riparian integrity can be positively associated with stream ecological status. This introduction to the CROSSLINK project shows the potential for our replicated study with its panoply of ecosystem attributes to help guide management decisions regarding the use of forested riparian buffers in human-impacted landscapes. This knowledge is highly relevant in a time of rapid environmental change where freshwater biodiversity is increasingly under pressure from a range of human impacts that include habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",

The lack of supportive legislature, and financial, communication and social barriers complicate the process of NBS implementation. It is an urgent need to develop approaches to design and implement NBS that would act as drivers to overcome potential barriers and enhance the social acceptability of the project. The vision-based decision-making methodology and participatory process created in this study has been carried out in the Koiliaris Critical Zone Observatory in Crete to design erosion and flood protection NBS and restore the riparian forest. The methodology consists of four distinct steps as follows: i) develop a vision of the area, ii) conduct a baseline assessment study, iii) NBS design and co-design, and iv) procurement and implementation. The methodology overcame multiple barriers because of the effective stakeholder engagement and the vision \"drove\" the project and created the necessary consensus that is necessary to achieve the objective of converting privately owned prime agricultural land to riparian forest.

       " 'Integrating natural processes to build areas through the creation of green infrastructure (GI) in Africa with its rapid urbanisation is a challenge because of the information base. The aim of this paper is planning a GI linking biophysical, social, and legal contents in a specific Africa country with an approach that combines different scales and different levels of data and information. The paper proposes a framework beginning at the macro scale to integrate and operationalise the definition of GI in an African context, namely for the Luanda metropolitan area. The approach to nature and ecological structure (GI) has four phases: analysis, integration, diagnosis and proposal. All steps are developed in a GIS environment and consider variations in the biophysical, social, cultural, and legal dimensions. The research discusses the problems in collecting existing information and leads with missing data within the context of urbanisation growth and climate change adaptation. The proposed green infrastructure includes protected areas (existing and proposed), natural values, risk areas, rivers, and agricultural areas, to increase resilience and flexibility in an adaptation context. The results allow to include in the GI the mangrove areas, native flora, vegetated slopes, and riverbanks, providing a buffering function for natural hazards, crucial for these regions, with the aim to achieve the needs of creating a strategic GI to be implemented into the Luanda General Master Plan. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'This is the first study that describes the effect of adding mitigation measures on the freshwater biodiversity of all waterbody types in agricultural catchments. We measured alpha (site) and gamma (catchment) richness annually over a nine-year period in all the streams, ponds and ditches in three upper-catchments in the English lowlands, and investigated whether freshwater plant biodiversity could be increased by adding: (i) multi-functional ecosystem services measures to intercept pollutants, store water and promote biodiversity, and, (ii) biodiversity-only protection measures. In the absence of measures, all catchments saw a decline in macrophyte richness during the survey (mean species loss of 1% pa, rare species loss of 2% pa). Ponds were a key habitat with a disproportionate influence on catchment trends. Five years after introducing measures, natural colonisation of ecosystem services waterbodies (dammed streams and ditches, runoff ponds, flood storage ponds) largely cancelled-out the background loss of plant species but, importantly, did not restore the loss of rare plants. Adding clean water ponds as a biodiversity-only enhancement measure brought substantial benefits: increasing total-catchment richness by 26%, and the number of rare plant species by 181%. Populations of spatially restricted species also increased. Adding stream debris-dams as a biodiversity measure did not affect plant richness or rarity. The findings suggest that ecosystem services measures could bring some biodiversity benefits to agricultural catchments. However, creating clean-water ponds specifically targeted for biodiversity could hold considerable potential as a tool to help stem, and even reverse, ongoing declines in freshwater plant biodiversity across farming landscapes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

The co-creation process is increasingly recognised as the way forward to deal with environmental issues in cities, allowing the development of associated methods and tools that have been described and published for specific stages. It is argued that the co-creation process comprises various interlinked stages, corresponding stakeholders, and subsequent methods and tools that need to be mapped and integrated across all stages. In this study, a Life Cycle Co-Creation Process (LCCCP) for NBS is developed, building on continuous improvement cycles and Design Thinking methodologies, and for which the stages and substages, involved stakeholders and engagement methods and tools are mapped and defined. For stakeholders, the actors of an Urban Living Lab (ULL) are adapted to the LCCCP; for the engagement methods and tools, the goals of stakeholder engagement are used as a guide to select examples of co-creation methods and tools.

       " 'Coastal urbanisation, energy extraction, food production, shipping and transportation have led to the global proliferation of artificial structures within the coastal and marine environments (sensu “ocean sprawl”), with subsequent loss of natural habitats and biodiversity. To mitigate and compensate impacts of ocean sprawl, the practice of eco-engineering of artificial structures has been developed over the past decade. Eco-engineering aims to create sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with the natural environment for the benefit of both. The science of eco-engineering has grown markedly, yet synthesis of research into a user-friendly and practitioner-focused format is lacking. Feedback from stakeholders has repeatedly stated that a “photo user guide” or “manual” covering the range of eco-engineering options available for artificial structures would be beneficial. However, a detailed and structured “user guide” for eco-engineering in coastal and marine environments is not yet possible; therefore we present an accessible review and catalogue of trialled eco-engineering options and a summary of guidance for a range of different structures tailored for stakeholders and end-users as the first step towards a structured manual. This work can thus serve as a potential template for future eco-engineering guides. Here we provide suggestions for potential eco-engineering designs to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services of coastal artificial structures with the following structures covered: (1) rock revetment, breakwaters and groynes composed of armour stones or concrete units; (2) vertical and sloping seawalls; (3) over-water structures (i.e., piers) and associated support structures; and (4) tidal river walls. © 2019, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Numerical modeling efforts in support of restoration and protection activities in coastal Louisiana have traditionally been conducted externally to any stakeholder engagement processes. This separation has resulted in planning- and project-level models built solely on technical observation and analysis of natural processes. Despite its scientific rigor, this process often fails to account for the knowledge, values, and experiences of local stakeholders that often contextualizes a modeled system. To bridge this gap, a team of natural and social scientists worked directly with local residents and resource users to develop a participatory modeling approach to collect and utilize local knowledge about the Breton Sound Estuary in southeast Louisiana, USA. Knowledge capture was facilitated through application of a local knowledge mapping methodology designed to catalog local understanding of current and historical conditions within the estuary and identify desired ecological and hydrologic end states. The results of the mapping endeavor informed modeling activities designed to assess the applicability of the identified restoration solutions. This effort was aimed at increasing stakeholder buy-in surrounding the utility of numerical models for planning and designing coastal protection and restoration projects and included an ancillary outcome aimed at elevating stakeholder empowerment regarding the design of nature-based restoration solutions and modeling scenarios. This intersection of traditional science and modeling activities with the collection and analysis of traditional ecological knowledge proved useful in elevating the confidence that community members had in modeled restoration outcomes. © 2019, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Wind erosion is an important environmental issue in Central Asia (CA), which includes Xinjiang, China (XJ-China), and the five CA states of the former Soviet Union (CAS5). Future climate changes could accelerate wind erosion in arid and semiarid areas and negatively impact local soil health and productivity. Based on the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b) climate model, we simulated the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil wind erosion from 1986 to 2099 in CA using the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model. Our analysis indicated that the annual soil wind erosion modulus during the prediction period (2006–2099) increased compared with that in the reference period (1986–2005), especially in the 2030s (18.71%) and 2050s (18.85%) under RCP4.5. Spring and winter soil wind erosion will be the major contributors to increased annual wind erosion. We predicted that spring soil wind erosion will increase by 10.34% (RCP4.5) to 10.71% (RCP8.5) and that winter soil wind erosion will increase by 23.32% (RCP4.5) to 33.74% (RCP8.5) in the late 21st century. Annual soil wind erosion will increase in the northwest of CA, but decrease in the Karakum Desert, Kyzylkum Desert and Taklimakan Desert. Soil wind erosion varies under different plant functional types. By the late 21st century, the soil wind erosion modulus in grassland, irrigated cropland and rainfed cropland will increase by 62 t/km2/a (RCP4.5) to 412 t/km2/a (RCP8.5), 27 t/km2/a (RCP4.5) to 88 t/km2/a (RCP8.5) and 141 t/km2/a (RCP4.5) to 237 t/km2/a (RCP8.5), respectively. Our study indicates high risks of soil wind erosion in northwestern CA, and ecological engineering measures such as nature based solutions including ecological barriers should be developed to prevent soil loss in central and western Kazakhstan, where future warming will bring severe stress. © 2019',\n",

However, the implementation of nature-based solutions stems from a discourse that is almost exclusively derived from a terrestrial and urban context and assumes that risk reduction is resolved locally. We argue that this position ignores the importance of complex ecological interactions across a range of temporal and spatial scales and misses the substantive contribution from marine ecosystems, which are notably absent frommost climatemitigation and adaptation strategies that extend beyond coastal disaster management. Here, we consider the potential of sediment-dwelling fauna and flora to inform and support nature-based solutions, and howthe ecology of benthic environments can enhance adaptation plans. We illustrate our thesis with examples of practice that are generating, or have the potential to deliver, transformative change and discuss where further innovation might be applied.

Success, however, will need much higher targets for environmental protection than the present 10% of sea and 17% of land. A new target of 30% of the sea given high levels of protection from exploitation and harm by 2030 is under consideration and similar targets are being discussed for terrestrial habitats.

       " 'As cities face increasing pressure from densification trends, green roofs represent a valuable source of ecosystem services for residents of compact metropolises where available green space is scarce. However, to date little research has been conducted regarding the holistic benefits of green roofs at a citywide scale, with local policymakers lacking practical guidance to inform expansion of green roofs coverage. The study addresses this issue by developing a spatial multi-criteria screening tool applied in Barcelona, Spain to determine: 1) where green roofs should be prioritized in Barcelona based on expert elicited demand for a wide range of ecosystem services and 2) what type of design of potential green roofs would optimize the ecosystem service provision. As inputs to the model, fifteen spatial indicators were selected as proxies for ecosystem service deficits and demands (thermal regulation, runoff control, habitat and pollination, food production, recreation, and social cohesion) along with five decision alternatives for green roof design (extensive, semi-intensive, intensive, naturalized, and allotment). These indicators and alternatives were analyzed probabilistically and spatially, then weighted according to feedback from local experts. Results of the assessment indicate that there is high demand across Barcelona for the ecosystem services that green roofs potentially might provide, particularly in dense residential neighborhoods and the industrial south. Experts identified habitat, pollination and thermal regulation as the most needed ES with runoff control and food production as the least demanded. Naturalized roofs generated the highest potential ecosystem service provision levels for 87.5% of rooftop area, apart from smaller areas of central Barcelona where intensive rooftops were identified as the preferable green roof design. Overall, the spatial model developed in this study offers a flexible screening based on spatial multi-criteria decision analysis that can be easily adjusted to guide municipal policy in other cities considering the effectiveness of green infrastructure as source of ecosystem services. © 2019 The Authors',\n",

(eds.), Global Coastal Issues of 2020. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 743-747. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. A growing interest in nature-based solutions has gained unprecedented attention in the coastal risk management, to complement or replace conventional approaches like hard structures (dykes, seawalls, breakwaters). However, due to the diversity of coastal ecosystems and the heterogeneity of the ecosystem service of wave attenuation they can induce, the integration of their protective role in an accurate way into risk studies remains rare. This paper shows an experimental methodology to integrate this ecosystem service into the risk mapping at very high spatial resolution using in situ sensors, airborne LiDAR and spaceborne satellite imagery. Risk study is achieved using a combination of indices which allows to evaluate the asset's exposure and vulnerability. The nature-based solution is also integrated through the creation of an adaptive capacity index, based on a spatially-explicit model of wave attenuation. The study enables to highlight the assets which are the most concerned by the marine flooding risk, using a synthetic risk index ranging from 0 to 1. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.\",\n",

This work investigates the hydrodynamic response of two small and shallow bays located in the Ebro Delta, in order to solve the problems affecting mussel farms, such as the high temperatures reached in the summer period (>28 °C), causing the death of these bivalves, and the limited water renewal that causes anoxia within the bay. Nature Based Solutions are described focusing on two aspects: one, modifying the flow of these drainage channels, increasing the arrival of freshwater to the bays; and two, opening a gap in the sand bars so that there is a flow of sea water in and out through the innermost zone, which is where both bays have greater problems of water renewal. The impact of those solutions simulated with the Regional Oceans Modeling System (ROMS), consist of a set of nested domains that use CMEMS-IBI data for the initial and open boundary conditions (coarser domain). To validate the numerical model, data from in situ campaigns have been used for one full year (2014) for Alfacs Bay, and for the summer period (July-August 2017) for Fangar Bay. In addition, the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is also studied as an indicator to reduce the mortality problems of mussels, but the results obtained do not reduce this variable. What the results do show is a decrease in residence time in both bays for both experiments, with the increase in flow being more viable than the increase in sand bar breakage. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.',\n",

However, GI contributions to urban resilience will not be realized until it is more fully mainstreamed in the built environment and design professions. Here, we interrogate five key challenges for the effective implementation of GI: (1) design standards; (2) regulatory pathways; (3) socio-economic considerations; (4) financeability; and (5) innovation. Methods include a literature review, case studies, and interviews with resilience managers. We propose a people-centred and context-dependent approach to advance effective implementation of GI in urban planning. We highlight two underlying currents that run across all of the challenges–(1) the role of political will as a pre-condition for tackling all challenges holistically; and (2) the role of stakeholder engagement in achieving public support, harnessing funding, and maintaining and monitoring GI in the long term. Highlights: •\\u2003The effective implementation of GI is context-specific and should adhere to the basic principles of appropriate technology. •\\u2003Continuous community engagement is needed to ensure the inclusivity and multi-functionality of GI. •\\u2003Challenges to successful GI are intersectional and therefore cannot be addressed singly in isolation. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

       " \"Urban waters represent a crucial component for the enhancement of urban resilience due to their importance in cities. Nature-based solutions (NBS) have emerged as sustainable solutions to contribute to urban resilience in order to meet the challenges of climate change. In order to promote the use of NBS for increasing urban resilience, tools that demonstrate the value of this type of solutions over the long-term are required. A performance assessment system provides an adequate basis for demonstrating this value, as well as for diagnosing the current city situation, selecting and monitoring the implementation of solutions. Regarding NBS management, some assessment approaches have been published, focusing on assessing the effectiveness of NBS in the face of climate change and supporting their design and impact assessment. Nevertheless, an integrated approach to assess the NBS contribution for urban resilience has not been published. This paper presents a comprehensive resilience assessment framework (RAF) to evaluate the NBS contribution for urban resilience, focused on solutions for stormwater management and control. Furthermore, details on stakeholders' validation, with focus on the metrics' relevance and applicability to cities, is also presented. © 2020 by the authors.\",\n",
       " 'Conventional urban drainage approaches have historically focused on the volume of stormwater to be displaced with the aim of moving it as fast and as far as possible from the city. They have also been negligent regarding water quality and the inherent value of watercourses to distinct forms of life in cities, from maintaining biodiversity to providing recreational space for residents. Contemporary responses to these issues point to a paradigm change: They seek to replicate the natural mechanisms of absorption and retention, with the aim of addressing pluvial drainage needs closer to the site of origin. This article aims to explore the extent to which such an approach could be accommodated in one dense and highly impervious setting in the Global South. Specifically, it compares urban morphology, land value, hydraulic performance, and politico-institutional conditions of grey and Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) scenarios in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The findings suggest that even in very dense and impervious urban basins it is possible to implement BGI with a significant effect in achieving urban-sustainability goals. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that it is possible to deculvert watercourses in line with Compact City principles through the development of hybrid BGI/grey-infrastructure systems. © 2020 by the authors.

       " \"The increasing interest in urban nature and its connection to urban sustainability and resilience has promoted the generalized use of new concepts such as green infrastructure, ecosystem services and nature-based solutions. However, due to their heterogeneous origins and interpretations, the usage and understanding of these concepts may vary considerably between different academic and professional groups, affecting their coordinated and synergistic use in integrative planning education and emphasizing the need for the exploration of clearer syntaxes and articulations between them. Accordingly, the main aim of this research was to develop a relational model and to investigate, through an external evaluation process, the benefits that these types of models can provide in higher education and in professional practice. This article presents the background theory and process that led to the development of the relational model, the outcomes of its academic implementation and the results of the assessment of both the model and the students' work by different types of planners, researchers and practitioners.

       " \"This opinion paper discusses urban lawns, the most common part of open green spaces and urban green infrastructures. It highlights both the ecosystem services and also disservices provided by urban lawns based on the authors' experience of working within interdisciplinary research projects on lawns in different cities of Europe (Germany, Sweden and Russia), New Zealand (Christchurch), USA (Syracuse, NY) and Australia (Perth). It complements this experience with a detailed literature review based on the most recent studies of different biophysical, social, planning and design aspects of lawns. We also used an international workshop as an important part of the research methodology. We argue that although lawns of Europe and the United States of America are now relatively well studied, other parts of the world still underestimate the importance of researching lawns as a complex ecological and social phenomenon. One of the core objectives of this paper is to share a paradigm of nature-based solutions in the context of lawns, which can be an important step towards finding resilient sustainable alternatives for urban green spaces in the time of growing urbanisation, increased urban land use competition, various user demands and related societal challenges of the urban environment. We hypothesise that these solutions may be found in urban ecosystems and various local native plant communities that are rich in species and able to withstand harsh conditions such as heavy trampling and droughts. To support the theoretical hypothesis of the relevance of nature-based solutions for lawns we also suggest and discuss the concept of two natures-different approaches to the vision of urban nature, including the understanding and appreciation of lawns. This will help to increase the awareness of existing local ecological approaches as well as an importance of introducing innovative landscape architecture practices. This article suggests that there is a potential for future transdisciplinary international research that might aid our understanding of lawns in different climatic and socio-cultural conditions as well as develop locally adapted (to environmental conditions, social needs and management policies) and accepted nature-based solutions. © 2020 by the authors.\",\n",

       " 'Cities are confronted with different societal challenges calling for urban sustainability transformation (UST). Nature-based solutions (NbS) can provide actions for such challenges and strive for maximizing environmental, social and economic benefits. Edible cities, which encompass different forms of urban food production (UFP) in the city, can be seen as multifunctional NbS. However, the concept of edible cities has just recently arrived in research and its understanding as potential NbS supporting UST is still fragmented. Therefore, the study created an analytical framework, which aims at identifying and prioritizing 1) challenges that edible cities can contribute in the context of UST and 2) strategies for implementing and mainstreaming the edible city in the context of urban sustainability acceleration. The study is of explorative character and encompasses interviews with key actors from three German case studies: Andernach – a German frontrunner in implementing the edible city, Haar – follower I, which implemented the concept after learning from Andernach and Munich – follower II, where the concept of edible cities was not yet implemented but a range of bottom-up activities exist to promote the topic. Results show that edible cities can be seen as NbS that can support UST in terms of social-spatial and socio-ecological transformation, in particular promoting social cohesion and human-nature and food connection. In terms of implementing and mainstreaming, the results suggest that the edible city can be taken up by different city departments due to its multifunctionality. Furthermore, a mix of motivated bottom-up initiatives and top-down authorities paired with courage and room for experimentation on the edible city is crucial for its embedding. Apart from that, network creation with different UFP initiatives as well as with other cities is an important factor for mainstreaming edible cities. Future research shall test the transferability of the analytical framework to other NbS analyzing their potential to contribute to UST. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'The conventional urban stormwater management practices focus on carrying away runoff quickly by lined conveyors, which increase the surface runoff and reduce the time of concentration, subsequently causing floods in downstream areas. Ecological Management Practices (EMPs) provide nature-based solutions for reducing flood risks in a sustainable and economically viable manner. However, in the rapidly urbanizing setups in developing nations, the application of EMPs is limited due to space availability, data scarcity and limited funding. This study uses a Non-Linear Programming Optimization Technique to provide modelling solutions in optimizing the land-use and costs under EMPs to reduce flood risks in the Quebrada Aries watershed in the Municipality of Heredia in Costa Rica. Depending on the availability and ease of execution, a combination of three EMPs (bio-retention areas, infiltration trenches and green roofs) were tested. The effect of the application of derived optimal combinations has been analysed. The optimal combination of EMPs analysed for different channel capacity was able to reduce the peak discharge for the worst flood causing event of 50\\xa0years return period from 16.86\\xa0m3/s (under current land-use) to 9 m3/s, 9.51\\xa0m3/s, 8.38\\xa0m3/s and 9.13\\xa0m3/s in four hypothetical scenarios considered. In urbanized catchments, EMPs cannot be applied indefinitely to avoid floods. However, an optimal combination of EMPs can drastically reduce the requirement of large capacity drainage channels. This information can help policy-makers to analyse trade-offs between urban development and flood control measures. The study is suitable for other data-scarce regions as well. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',\n",
       " \"In this study, we investigated the possibility of replacing existing lawns located in urban parks with patches of energy crop plantations as a way to reduce maintenance costs. We selected six sites located on the edges of urban parks in Warsaw (Poland), characterized by low aesthetical value, high noise levels, and low vegetation diversity. For these sites, we evaluated replacing existing vegetation with selected energy plant species from a social and economic perspective. We conducted face-to-face interviews with park visitors to assess the public's perception of the aesthetic value of the energy crops using a series of computerized visual simulations. Also, we analyzed the costs and benefits of energy crops cultivation over a 20-year cycle and compared them with the maintenance costs of the current management of lawns in parks. The results from the survey showed that after introducing energy crops in all the cases, the attractiveness of the parks’ interiors would increase compared to existing conditions. Replacing existing lawns would have a minor effect on vegetation diversity, and this would only concern species typical for turf lawns common in urban landscapes. We found that over 20 years, the production of biomass from 9 of the 13 species is related to lower costs than those related to maintaining existing lawns in Warsaw. Only for H. salicifolius, L. thuringiaca, S. pectinata, B. napus is the production of biomass non-profitable in comparison to maintaining existing vegetation. For all other species, we found losses in the production of biomass over 20 years. However, these losses are still lower than the costs of lawn maintenance, suggesting that planting ECs is more profitable than the existing green infrastructure. © 2020 Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW\",\n",
       " 'Cities are critical places for the emergence of sustainability transitions. The early phases of transition are often characterised by experimentation. Socio-spatial conditions, such as local policy, governance networks, localised learning and funding structures, are known to influence experimentation, yet there is little empirical knowledge on how these conditions contribute. We construct a framework to analyse how these conditions coincide with patterns in urban experimentation, distinguishing between incremental and radical experimentation and between social, technological, and systemic experiments. We introduce a method for large-N analysis and apply this to a database of 520 NBS in 100 European cities. This creates detailed insights into which socio-spatial conditions are associated with particular types of experimentation and how this relates to the urban innovative environment.

       " 'Nature-based flood defence is an innovative design alternative for achieving protection against flooding. Despite significant advancements in science, models and concepts, routine implementation beyond pilot projects remains limited. To better understand why, we have looked into the complexities of nature-based flood defence implementation and its resolutions, modelling decision-making situations using game theory in three nature-based flood defence cases: The Markermeer Dikes, the Afsluitdijk Dam and the Sand Engine. We observe that nature-based flood defence games are of a multi-level and nested nature. While the decision of whether to employ a nature-based flood defence is seemingly made at the project level, this can only happen when it is coherent with the institutional context that is determined at the policy level. A social dilemma is apparent: while a multi-functional nature-based solution is attractive to a coalition of actors, it is not the most beneficial option for individual actors. Hence, they are faced with the dilemma of opting for their maximum benefit or opting for the greater societal benefit which is less favorable to them. This social dilemma can be tackled by making ‘smart moves’, as inspired by the Sand Engine case. The nested nature of the problem requires structural change in the institutional context to enable favourable conditions for nature-based flood defence implementations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"Nature-based adaptation planning is a challenging endeavor, not least because it requires transdisciplinary approaches to unite different actors' efforts and capacities. However, empirical knowledge on associated governance processes is scarce and fragmented. Against this background, this paper examines the integration of nature-based approaches for climate change adaptation into municipalities’ daily planning practices and associated governance. A city-to-city learning lab was established to systematically analyze selected urban development projects step-by-step, from the initial idea, to comprehensive and detailed planning, procurement, implementation, maintenance and follow-up. The results show the numerous constraints municipal staff face and how they use targeted strategies to overcome them and tap into existing drivers. We identify five, complementary strategies: i) targeted stakeholder collaboration; ii) strategic citizen involvement; iii) outsourcing; iv) the alteration of internal working structures; and v) concealed science–policy integration. Importantly, these strategies reveal an increasing need for relational approaches that, in turn, require individuals to develop the cognitive/emotional capacity to establish trust, communicate inclusively and promote social learning, while at the same time dealing with an increasingly complex and uncertain working environment. We conclude that tapping into the potential of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation governance requires more financial and human resources, and capacity development to support personal development, systematic mainstreaming and, ultimately, more sustainable development. © 2019 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Climate change is presenting one of the main challenges to our planet. In parallel, all regions of the world are projected to urbanise further. Consequently, sustainable development challenges will be increasingly concentrated in cities. A resulting impact is the increment of expected urban flood risk in many areas around the globe. Adaptation to climate change is an opportunity to improve urban conditions through the implementation of green-blue infrastructures, which provide multiple benefits besides flood mitigation. However, this is not an easy task since urban drainage systems are complex structures. This work focuses on a method to analyse the trade-offs when different benefits are pursued in stormwater infrastructure planning. A hydrodynamic model was coupled with an evolutionary optimisation algorithm to evaluate different green-blue-grey measures combinations. This evaluation includes flood mitigation as well as the enhancement of co-benefits. We confirmed optimisation as a helpful decision-making tool to visualise trade-offs among flood management strategies. Our results show that considering co-benefits enhancement as an objective boosts the selection of green-blue infrastructure. However, flood mitigation effectiveness can be diminished when extra benefits are pursued. Finally, we proved that combining green-blue-grey measures is particularly important in urban spaces when several benefits are considered simultaneously. © 2019 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'There is increasing interest in distributing small-scale interventions across the landscape as an alternative means of reducing flood risk. One such intervention, the leaky barrier, is introduced in channels to slow down high flows and encourage temporary storage on the floodplain. While these barriers have been implemented widely, there is still resistance to their use at the scales required to impact significantly on flood risk, at least partially due to an evidence gap. In particular, there is no standard method for representing leaky barriers in hydraulic models. This study sets out a methodology for developing mathematical models which capture the hydraulics of leaky barriers accurately, allowing key questions about their combined behaviour in catchments to be answered. A 1D Godunov-type scheme is set up and leaky barriers incorporated with internal boundary conditions. This model is tested against benchmarks from the literature and new steady-state data, and then run predictively on transient cases. The method will help to answer key questions about the optimal leakiness of small-scale interventions, the limits to their usefulness, and how combinations of barriers may or may not cause synchronisation problems when the effect of multiple barriers is aggregated. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",

Applied research fields have emerged that try to increase adaptive capacity in these ecosystems, using concepts deriving from the theory of complex adaptive systems. How are these concepts of complexity interpreted and applied by practitioners? This study applies a mixed-methods approach to analyze the case of freshwater management in The Netherlands, where a management paradigm promoting nature-fixating interventions is recently being replaced with a new paradigm of nature-based solutions. We find that practitioners have widely varying interpretations of concepts and of how the ecosystems they work in have evolved over time when described with complex system attributes. This study allows for the emergence of key complexity-related considerations among practitioners that are not often discussed in literature: (i) the need for physical and institutional space for self-organization of nature; (ii) the importance of dependency and demand management; and (iii) trade-offs between robustness and flexibility.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) are usually defined as complementary or alternative solutions to \"grey infrastructures\" (traditionally made with cement) aimed at conserving and regenerating the functionality of natural and semi-natural ecosystems. The research to date shows a considerable potential of NBS to address the current challenges related to climate change and geo-hydrological risks. Despite significant interest in NBS by researchers and practitioners, knowledge concerning their practical implementation, monitoring, and evaluation is still lacking. This is particularly true for large-scale NBS. The present paper discusses how such solutions can be implemented in the context of hydro-meteorological risk reduction in small Mediterranean catchments with a strong tourist vocation. The work presented here is situated within the RECONECT Project (Regenerating ECOsystems with Nature-based solutions for hydro-meteorological risk rEduCTion), which aims to contribute to a European reference framework on NBS by demonstrating, upscaling, and replicating large-scale NBS in rural and natural areas. The Italian case study of RECONECT is the Portofino Natural Regional Park, which represents a unique natural landscape element with high ecologic, social, and economic (touristic) value, which is threatened by a range of geo-hydrological hazards, such as flash floods, hyper-concentrated floods, shallow landslides, rockfalls, and storm surges. This paper also presents details of NBS interventions in two pilot catchments (San Fruttuoso and Paraggi) visited by thousands of tourists throughout the year. It addresses some of the key aspects related to monitoring meteorological and hydrological processes, as well as remote sensing activities (i.e., LiDAR surveys), which are necessary for the identification of critical-instability areas along waterways and the reconstruction of dry stone walls. Lastly, a discussion of relevant mitigation and adaptation strategies that are potentially replicable at national and international levels is also provided. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'Soil erosion caused by climate and land-use changes is one of the biggest environmental challenges in highland Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess the future soil erosion risks and evaluate the potential conservation measures in the Rib watershed, northwestern highland Ethiopia. We used the HadGEM2-ES model with a moderate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration scenario (RCP4.5) to project the future climate. The future land-use patterns were predicted using the CA-Markov model. We integrated the RUSLE model with GIS to estimate the spatial distribution of soil loss and identify erosion risk areas. We found that the Rib watershed is highly vulnerable to future climate and land-use changes, leading to a high soil erosion risk. Despite slight growth of forest cover during the study period, the total soil loss for the watershed was estimated to be 7.93 × 106\\xa0t\\xa0year−1 in 2017 and was predicted to increase to 9.75 × 106\\xa0t\\xa0year−1 in 2050, an increase of about 23%. The increase in forest cover was due to the expansion of the area of eucalyptus plantations which are more prone to erosion. Moreover, field survey showed that the residual native forests are sparsely vegetated and mostly used for cattle grazing, increasing the erosion risk even more. In contrast, the combined use of afforestation with native trees and physical soil conservation measures in the upper areas of the catchment could decrease soil loss by 62%. Our results stress the importance of combining soil conservation measures, including converting eucalyptus plantations to native forests, to mitigate the effects of future climate change and increased agricultural production on soil erosion. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'In High Nature Value Farmland areas such as the woodlands locally known as ‘montado’, increasing tree cover is a nature-based solution to mitigate land degradation which leads to loss of productivity and increase susceptibility to climate change. In the Mediterranean dryland areas, native tree species such as Holm-oak provide important ecosystem services. Tree cover provides shadow and food for animals, contributes to soil organic matter and protects soil from erosion, increasing water infiltration and biodiversity, thus increasing woodlands’ resilience. However, Holm-oak trees are facing high mortality rates and low natural regeneration due to both environmental and anthropogenic factors, which call for reforestation actions. Yet, because of its high costs, reforestation must focus on the most degraded areas. Tracking tree canopy cover over space and time using remote-sensing techniques could allow land managers to understand which factors promote or hinder mortality, growth and regeneration at large spatial scales, and help to prioritize areas for restoration. Most studies evaluating tree cover use a space-for-time substitution, are rarely done over time, and address small areas, thus disregarding climate effects; those performing large-scale analysis (i.e. over space) of satellite images seldom provide ground-validated information. To overcome these limitations, this study uses satellite imagery to quantify spatial and temporal changes in tree cover. This was done relating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to aerial photography photointerpretation, over a precipitation gradient in a Mediterranean dryland area. Dry-season NDVI was positively related with tree canopy cover changes, both over space and time. The spatial–temporal models developed here were then validated with independent data and applied over a large area to create regional maps of changes in Holm-oak canopy cover over space and time. Thus, NDVI based-data can be used in large-scale assessments of Holm-oak canopy cover. Our findings provide an important tool to improve forest management strategies, e.g. by enabling to map and quantify tree cover decline, and to prioritize areas for reforestation, thus improving ecosystem services delivery in Holm-oak woodlands, such as improving farmland productivity and resilience to climate change. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
       " 'The effect of different “green” measures, such as the increase of urban green areas, the application of green roofs and the increase of surfaces albedo on urban air quality were evaluated with the WRF-CHIMERE modelling system. In order to account for the heterogeneity of urban areas, a single layer urban canopy model was coupled to the WRF model. The case study consists of a heat wave occurring in the Porto (Portugal) urban area in a future climate scenario, considering the Representative Concentration Pathway RCP8.5. The influence of the selected measures on PM10, NO2 and O3 concentrations was quantified and compared with a control run (without measures) simulation scenario. The results revealed that all the measures are able to mitigate the effects of heat waves by reducing the air temperature between −0.5 °C and −1 °C (maximum differences for the mean of the episode). Positive and negative effects were found in terms of air quality. The implementation of green roofs and the increase of surfaces albedo promoted an overall increase of PM10 (between +0.6% and +1.5%) and NO2 (between +0.8% and 3.5%) concentrations, which are closely related to a decrease of vertical mixing in the urban boundary layer. The increase of green urban areas promoted an overall decrease (on average) of both PM10 and NO2, by around −1% and −3%, respectively. The O3 levels increased with the increase of urban green areas, mostly located over the Porto urban area. Slight differences were promoted by the implementation of green roofs. For the increase of surfaces albedo, both increases and decreases of O3 concentrations were observed. The obtained results contribute to the knowledge of the chemical composition of the urban atmosphere and can be of great importance for stakeholders and decision-makers to deal with climate change impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'There is a rising demand to use nature and natural processes to address a different range of urban issues, especially when looking at the risk of pluvial flood associated with climate changes and urbanization processes. Among the set of Nature-Based Solutions used in urban planning, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) represent promising solutions to reduce the negative effects of urban water run-offs and to increase urban Ecosystem Services. However, SUDS can impact differently in the urban fabric and generate positive effects only on particular portions of cities. Planning of SUDS should try to consider not only the number of potential beneficiaries but also where beneficiaries are located in the city, as water sensitive approaches to urban planning must deal with distributive, procedural and contextual dimensions of equity. In this paper, we simulate different spatially explicit planning scenarios of SUDS for densely populated catchments in Sicily. Particularly, we evaluate the relation between the quantitative performance of SUDS in terms of reduction of hazard/risk of pluvial flooding and the number and location of beneficiaries -intended here as residents of different social groups. Results suggest that scenarios of SUDS generate benefits that are not equally distributed within the city. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'As the linked impacts of climate change and degradation of ecosystems continue to be felt, particularly in developing countries, it is vital that methods for development that concurrently address adaptation to climate change, rapid urbanisation, and ecosystem degradation be explored. Further development of approaches which are participatory and embedded in an understanding of the importance of symbiotic relationships between socio-cultural and ecological systems is particularly important. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is one such method that is gaining recognition and momentum in areas where developing nations face converging pressures and drivers of change. EbA methodologies to date, are often ill-defined in an urban context and lack consideration of future social and ecological scenarios however. In response, this paper describes a methodology for developing urban EbA projects in a small island developing nation context.

The application of this methodology in Port Vila, Vanuatu indicated: i) the needs of local people must be at the forefront of project planning, requiring a participatory design process; ii) EbA solutions development must be multidisciplinary and iterative; iii) appropriate quantitative and qualitative data is vital as a basis for EbA project development, requiring adequate time for data gathering; iv) urban and coastal EbA projects must be developed holistically, recognising socio-ecological systems that extend beyond the urban area itself; v) the complex overlapping landscape of governmental and international aid financed projects must inform the development of new EbA projects; vi) potential monetary and non-monetary benefits, costs and risks across multiple factors must be carefully assessed in EbA project development; and vii) project implementation requires ongoing engagement and a readiness to adapt to on-the-ground realities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Traditional land-use planning models have been unable to completely address environmental protection concerns without taking into account the suitability of the land to host a specific function or its consistency within a wider territorial context. Nowadays, new Planning approaches tend to a new paradigm considering a qualitative dimension of the public city based on performance standards considering the possible provision of multiple benefits in terms of regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services. The paper provides the results of an experience conducted in the municipality of Rescaldina, located in the northern part of the Milan Metropolitan area, where traditional quantitative standards were overpass towards a performance standards approach based on Ecosystem Services (ES) provision. ES provision via spatial planning has been advocated through Green infrastructure (GI) while NBS are considered as the greening design actions that can contribute to developing GI. The areas (public and private) included in the GI have a specific planning regulation for its implementation and its operability. The GI strategy was defined in the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as a support tool for setting Planning strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'As exposure to coastal hazards increases there is growing interest in nature-based solutions for risk reduction. This study uses high-resolution flood and loss models to quantify the impacts of coastal wetlands in the northeastern USA on (i) regional flood damages by Hurricane Sandy and (ii) local annual flood losses in Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey. Using an extensive database of property exposure, the regional study shows that wetlands avoided $625 Million in direct flood damages during Hurricane Sandy. The local study combines these models with a database of synthetic storms in Ocean County and estimates a 16% average reduction in annual flood losses by salt marshes with higher reductions at lower elevations. Together, the studies quantify the risk reduction ecosystem services of marsh wetlands. Measuring these benefits in collaboration with the risk modelling industry is crucial for assessing risk accurately and, where appropriate, aligning conservation and risk reduction goals. © 2017 The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'This article investigated the knowledge and practice of a nature-based solution to reduce disaster risks of drought, veld fires and floods using wetlands in the eastern Free State, South Africa. A mixed research method approach was used to collect primary data using three data collection tools, namely questionnaires, interviews and field observations. Ninety-five wetlands under communal and private ownership as well as a few in protected areas were sampled, with their users completing questionnaires. The study showed that communal wetlands were more degraded, while wetlands in protected areas and in private commercial farms were in a good ecological state. An extensive literature review reveals that healthy wetlands are effective buffers in reducing disaster risks such as drought, veld fires and floods which are recurrent in the study area. Therefore, through better land-use and management practices, backed by education and awareness, wetlands could be good instruments to mitigate recurrent natural hazards in the agriculturally dominated eastern Free State in South Africa. © 2018.

       " \"Progressing urbanisation is one of the key causes of environmental degradation. This problem also applies to stormwater management. For this reason, drainage infrastructures should be designed in harmony with nature and the decision for selecting a specific stormwater management system solution must not be taken on an ad-hoc or single-perspective basis. The purpose of this paper is to identify the criteria for selecting the best solution for a problem involving the selection of a stormwater management system, and to present a method that will enable all relevant criteria to be taken into account in the decision-making process. The developed decision problem structure takes into account all criteria related to the construction and operation of stormwater infrastructure, and its individual elements were identified based on the analysis and synthesis of information regarding the principles of stormwater management in Poland. The presented approach will allow for the taking into account of all, often mutually exclusive, criteria determining the choice of the stormwater management system option. This, in turn, will make it possible to significantly simplify the decision-making process. The indicated criteria can form the basis for choosing the most favorable stormwater management system for both large urban catchments and individual facilities. Thanks to the considerable flexibility of the developed decision problem structure, its widespread application can contribute to improving the efficiency of stormwater management systems. An example of the developed model's application in a decision-making process is presented, concerning the selection of a design variant of a single-family residential building's stormwater management system in Poland. Four design variants were included in the analysis, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process was used as the tool to select the most favorable option. This study shows that nature-based solutions are the most beneficial decision stormwater management options. © 2020 by the authors.\",\n",

The assessment of the implementation of urban green infrastructure actions, as any other type of intervention, involves the use of indicators to measure the effects of these actions. These indicators are understood as parameters that allow assessing the impact and the temporary monitoring of the effects of human actions carried out on the territory. Drawing on the literature of ecosystem/landscape services and green infrastructure, this study proposes a set of indicators which are able to analyse the performance of urban green infrastructure in terms of structure and functionality. A selection of the proposed indicators connected to structural properties, regulation and cultural landscape services are tested at the street level in Valencia City, Spain. Indicators are applied in two pilot actions which are being developed in Benicalap District, Valencia, in the context of a broader project which aims to give evidence about the benefits of nature-based solutions. This research contributes to a better understanding of how indicators can be used as an effective tool to assess the landscape services provided by urban green infrastructure.

       " 'Polluted land in marginalized regions, such as tropical low-income countries and sparsely populated regions in industrialised countries, demand special remediation strategies that are energy-efficient, locally adapted, economically viable. Strategies for appropriate bioremediation technology under such circumstances can be based on locally available resources in combination with in situ bioremediation technologies to keep energy and material costs down. A pilot scale experiment was set up to test the application of three organic by-products from the local industry (whey, pyroligneous acid and compost tea) to enhance the natural biodegradation of diesel in ultisol. Biweekly applications of 6 mL whey kg−1 soil significantly increased the degradation rate but no positive effect on degradation was found with any of the other amendments. Tropical climate is favourable for biodegradation but many tropical soils are rich in clay which can inhibit the bioavailability of the pollutant which in turn may be decisive for biodegradation kinetics. If low cost is a crucial factor, our results indicate that whey treatment has the potential to be an appropriate technology for treating petroleum-contaminated soils in tropical regions. © 2020 The Author(s).

       " 'Coastal wetlands have disproportionately high carbon densities, known as blue carbon, compared to most terrestrial ecosystems. Mangroves and their blue carbon stocks are at risk globally from land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) activities such as aquaculture, alongside biophysical disturbances such as sea-level rise and cyclones. Global estimates of carbon emissions from mangrove loss have been previously unable to differentiate between the variable impacts of different drivers of loss. This article discusses the impacts that different LULCC activities and biophysical disturbances have on carbon stocks (biomass and soil) and greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4). The dynamics of carbon stocks and fluxes depends on the type of LULCC; aquaculture often results in biomass and soil carbon removal, and some forms of agriculture can substantially increase methane emissions. Natural disturbances have mixed impacts on mangrove carbon; sea-level rise will drown some mangroves and their carbon stocks but provide opportunities for new carbon accumulation, while cyclones can have immediate negative impacts on stocks but positive impacts on sequestration during recovery. Mangrove rehabilitation practices can actively restore carbon stocks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from previous land uses. It is critical to consider the type of LULCC when estimating carbon emissions due to mangrove loss or rehabilitation. Mangrove blue carbon is now high on the international conservation policy agenda, and a better understanding of how carbon stocks and fluxes respond to anthropogenic and biophysical disturbance may provide better incentives for mangrove conservation and sustainable management. © 2020 US Government.',\n",

In order to enable “learning by comparing” and “generating new knowledge” from multiple NBS related studies, a novel data and knowledge base is needed which requires a specified methodological approach for its development. This paper provides conceptual and methodological context and techniques for constructing such a data and knowledge base that will systematically support the process of NBS monitoring and assessment: • A methodology presents the comprehensive, multi-step approach to the NBS data and knowledge development that helps to guide work and influence the quality of an information included. • The paper describes the methodology and main steps/phases for developing a large data and knowledge base of NBS that will allow further systematic review. • The suggested methodology explains how to build NBS related databases from the conceptualization and requirements phases through to implementation and maintenance. In this regard, such a methodology is iterative, with extensive NBS stakeholders’ and end-user's involvement that are packaged with reusable templates or deliverables offering a good opportunity for success when used by practitioners and other end-users. • The NBS data and knowledge base gathers information about different NBS models and generations into one easy-to-find, easy-to-use place and provides detailed descriptions of each of the 1490 NBS cases from urban centers in Europe. • The data and knowledge base thus helps users identify the best and most appropriated NBS model/type for addressing the particular goals and, at the same time, considers the local context and potential. • The data obtained can be used for the further meta-analysis by applying statistics or searching for specific sample cases and thus enables to generate and expand the knowledge from multiple NBS related studies, in both qualitative and quantitative ways. © 2020 The Author(s)\",\n",

These hazards enhance erosion processes and flooding events, producing severe socio-economic impacts and posing a challenge to ocean engineers and stakeholders in finding the optimal strategy to protect both the coastal communities and the health of the environment. The impact of coastal hazards is actually worsened not only by an enhancing rate of relative sea level rise and storminess driven by climate changes, but also by increasing urban pressure related to the development of the sea economy. With regard to larger environmental awareness and climate change adaptation needs, the present study focuses on a stepwise approach that supports the actions for coastal protection at Calabaia Beach, which is located in the Marine Experimental Station of Capo Tirone (Cosenza, Italy). These actions first aim to protect humans and coastal assets, then to restore the environment and the local habitat, overcoming the need for the emergency interventions carried out in the last decades and pointing out that healthy ecosystems are more productive and support a sustainable marine economy (\"Blue Growth\"). © 2020 by the authors.',\n",

Several cities have identified the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) as an option to mitigate several challenges at once. However, can two different aims be reached with NBS in the same location? This question has not yet been addressed. This paper discusses the spatial compatibility of NBS implementation strategies to tackle (1) urban heat island (UHI) effects and (2) water pollution at the same location. The evaluation is based on a spatial analysis of Berlin. We found a positive correlation of high UHI and median high stormwater pollution loads for zinc, total suspended solids, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Terbutryn. Out of more than 14,000 building/street sections analyzed, 2270 showed spatial matching of high UHI and high stormwater pollution loads. In the majority of building/street sections, stormwater pollution was high for three out of the four parameters. We conclude that the compatibility of NBS implementation for both challenges depends both on the implementation strategies for NBS and on the specific NBS measures.

These solutions are attracting key scientific and marketing attention thanks to their capability to improve indoor and outdoor thermal comfort and environmental quality of spaces. In urban areas, where most of the population worldwide lives, indoor-outdoor environmental quality is compromised by local and temporary overheating phenomena, air pollution concentration, and impervious surfaces minimizing urban space resilience to climate change related hazards. In this view, the proposed study concerns the analysis of a greenery system for enhancing outdoor thermal conditions and local warming mitigation for pedestrians for the continental Mediterranean climate. The system has the purpose of designing an outdoor \"alive\" shading system to be applied in open public spaces, with producing physical and societal benefits. The experimental results showed that the implementation of the greenery, characterized by lower surface temperatures and evapotranspiration compared to a simple pergola system, allows the reduction of outdoor air temperature under the shading system and, thus, higher relative humidity in summer. Specifically, the hygrothermal cooling and the additional shading thanks to the presence of greenery provide local air temperature reduction up to 5 °C at pedestrian level. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",

This paper considers how green spaces may be designed to promote human mental health. Previous research reports that certain nature quality types, Perceived Sensory Dimensions (PSDs), have positive impacts on mental health. This paper aims to describe operationalisation of the PSDs into an applicable design tool for practitioners, such as landscape architects and urban planners. The paper includes the application of the tool in the design of Health Forest Octovia® research and demonstration setting. This operationalisation resulted in a design tool with six steps: 1. Determine the aim of the PSD, 2. Determine the scale, 3. Identify context, 4. Identify existing rooms, 5. Identify and graduate existing PSDs, and 6. Start design phase. After establishing Health Forest Octovia®, a research study validated the health-promoting design. Further validation of the design tool, however, requires its application in other research-based design projects. The current study concludes that the 8 PSD health-promoting design tool could function as an evidence-based design tool for nature-based solutions and could enhance sustainable urbanisation by promoting the mental health of residents. © 2020, Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.',\n",

However, ecosystems can also protect people from climate change impacts. As the evidence base strengthens, nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly prominent in climate change policy, especially in developing nations. Yet intentions rarely translate into measurable, evidence-based targets. As Paris Agreement signatories revise their Nationally Determined Contributions, we argue that NbS are key to meeting global goals for climate and biodiversity, and we urge researchers to work more closely with policy-makers to identify targets that benefit both people and ecosystems. Technical summary Recent research demonstrates that nature-based solutions (NbS) can help protect communities and infrastructure from the impacts of climate change while providing a range of other benefits for society. As nations revise or prepare new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in support of the Paris Agreement, there is a major opportunity to increase global ambition on NbS. To support this process and to provide a baseline against which ambition for NbS can be tracked, here we report on the prominence of NbS in the 168 NDCs that were submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In total, 104 nations include NbS in the adaptation component of their NDCs, 77 nations include them in both their adaptation and mitigation components and an additional 27 include them as part of their mitigation plans only. In other words, 131 nations – or 66% of all signatories to the Paris Agreement – have articulated intentions of working with ecosystems, in one form or another. However, national intentions to deliver NbS for adaptation vary by level of economic development, region and habitat type, and rarely translate into measurable evidence-based targets. We discuss possible reasons for these findings and provide recommendations on how national governments, practitioners and researchers can together enhance ambition for NbS to climate change impacts. As climate pledges are revised during successive global ‘stock takes’ of the Paris Agreement, we urge the research community to work closely with practitioners and policy-makers to identify meaningful targets that benefit both people and the ecosystems on which they depend.

Assessment methodology employs 20 indicators of resilience in SEPLS jointly developed by the United Nations University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS) and Biodiversity International; an \"Explain-Score-Discuss-Suggest\" model is applied. Results show that the communities\\' primary issues of concern and adjustments to the action plan are related to biodiversity-based livelihoods, transfer of traditional knowledge, and sustainable use of common resources. The study concludes that this approach has a high potential to help facilitate nature-based solutions for human well-being and biodiversity benefits in Xinshe SEPLS. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Urban regeneration seeks to improve the quality of the urban environment, to develop new urban land use, to stimulate social cohesion and economic activity, as well as the protection of urban land and ecosystems. They follow to provide environmental, social and economic benefits, which complies with Nature-based Solutions (NbSs). The aim of the paper is to test if the different features of NbSs could be identified in former post-industrial regeneration projects. For our analysis, we considered 32 projects from 28 post-industrial cities and 11 European countries. For these projects, we perform a content-analysis to identify how the different key features that define NbSs (Eklipse Challenge's, human interventions, processes, social benefits, co-benefits and stakeholder involvement) have been addressed. We use Social Network Analysis (SNA) in order to investigate the role and influence of the stakeholders within the network. Our findings show that there is a moderate compatibility between former post-industrial regeneration projects and the key features of NbSs. However, the past experiences point out that municipalities and experts are key stakeholders that initiate and support the implementation of the regeneration projects. Understanding how former post-industrial regeneration projects have worked helps the development of the effective approaches to promote sustainable solutions, including NbSs. © 2020 Earth and Environmental Team, Romania.\",\n",
       " 'This research focuses on how green urban infrastructure contributes to adapt and mitigate climate change consequences. It analyses the benefits derived from an overall green urban regeneration, including green roofs, green façades and sustainable urban drainage. This would contribute to both climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions, including the following: reduction in cooling and heating demand; bio-retention of stormwater and consequently ameliorating risks of floods; reducing hot spots which create urban heat island and improving urban health. This paper first categorizes green urban infrastructure solutions. It analyses a series of case studies conducted in Germany, Spain, Canada and the USA; in order to identify the contribution to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It develops a set of measurable figures which define the contribution of an overall green urban solution intervention. It applies this assessment specifically to an urban space of Amurrio (Araba, Spain) and to an existing building of Balmaseda (Bizkaia, Spain). It finally analyses evaluation tools for governments and planning institutions to improve planning strategies and policy developments. The paper presents the results, concluding that climate change mitigation and adaptation green urban solutions are mainly achieved when applied in the larger scale of a whole city. © 2020 WITPress.

       " 'Urban living style is associated with various negative impacts on human health, e.g. connected with the environmental problems. Thus, promoting health of urban population is nowadays one of the most challenging issues of the 21st century together with the growing needs for sustainable development and establishment of the biophilic or livable cities. It is increasing awareness among researchers and health practitioners of the potential benefits to the health from activities in natural settings and especially from regular contact with nature, which can be perceived as a preventive medical tool. This paper discusses the close relationship between the concepts of health-supporting landscapes and sustainability in modern cities based on literature review and case studies from EU, Russian and Australian projects. We first review the historical and modern paradigms (of the various disciplines) which determine the discourse in nature - human health and well-being research. This includes examination of Hippocrates «naturalistic history», Humboldt’s concept of natural garden design; Oertel ‘s ‘Terrain Kur’; «salutogenic approach» of Antonovsky; McHarg’s Design with Nature; Ecopolis programme, Wilson’s biophilia and some other approaches. Then there is a comparative analysis of structural similarities and differences in the past and current scientific schools devoted to understanding human - landscape interaction. One of the principal arguments is that nature also has another value for health, regardless of natural remedies. It includes, for example, the healing of space, outdoor training trails in parks, everyday use of urban green spaces and peri-urban recreation areas for sport and exercises. We provide an analysis of some examples based on the modern concepts of biophilic cities, therapeutic landscapes, healing gardens, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions. This article also discusses the main types of healing gardens and therapeutic landscapes and suggests the framework of design principles of healing and therapeutic landscapes. The analysis proved that healing gardens and therapeutic landscapes provide multiple benefits and can be regarded as nature-based solutions. These essential aspects of multifunctionality, multiculturality and social inclusion are well intertwined with the approach of biophilia. © 2020, Russian Geographical Society.

       " 'The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is closely related to sustainability, harmonious and green development, resource rational exploitation, coupled human health and environment, and ecological protection priority. Bio-slow sand filtration (BSSF) technology is a green water treatment technology with low energy consumption, simple operation, and a high removal rate of contaminants. To achieve low cost, easy management and secondary pollution avoidance in the process of removing contaminants in drinking water, the rational selection of biofiltration materials and the optimal combination of particle size are particularly important based on NBS. To effectively remove turbidity, organic pollutants, bacteria, and ammonia nitrogen by BSSF, three scenarios were summarized by considering the influence of sensitive parameter optimization and the external environment (temperature and velocity). We designed three BSSF water treatment testing devices, which were filled with bio-filter materials with different particle sizes (0.15-0.3 mm, 0.3-0.9 mm, 0.9-1.35 mm, and 0.3-0.9 mm), to carry out an indoor testing comparison analysis. We optimized important parameters of BSSF water treatment technology (such as the bio-filter material particle size and filling heights, filtering velocity, and suitable temperature) to obtain the best design and operational parameters of BSSF water treatment technology. The optimum operating conditions were: filter material particle size of 0.3-0.6 mm, filling height of 0.6-0.9 m, filtering velocity of 0.2-0.6 m/h, and a suitable temperature of 15-35ºC. To ensure the water quality of the filtered water, we optimized the design parameters of traditional BSSF technology, which could save land and reduce beginning time. BSSF water treatment technology based on NBS is useful for promoting the engineering application of drinking water treatment and regional water security. © 2020, HARD Publishing Company.

       " 'Nature-based solutions, such as Constructed Wetlands (CWs), for the treatment of industrial wastewater can be more efficiently operated making use of online monitored parameters as inlet/outlet flows and concentrations for specific substances. The present study compares different datasets acquired in a two-and-a-half-year-long period by normal laboratory methods and also from a specific COD/BOD sensor installed at a winery CWs wastewater treatment plant in Tuscany, Italy. The CW wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is composed of: equalization tank (70 m3); French Reed Bed (1200 m2); horizontal subsurface flow (HF) CW (960 m2): free water system (850 m2); optional post-treatment sand filter (50 m2); and emergency recirculation. The obtained average performances for this last period are for COD 97.5%, for MBAS 93.1%, for N-NO2- 84.7%, for NO3- 39.9%, and for TP 45.5%. The online sensor has shown excellent performance in following the COD concentration patterns along the observed period. The qualitative and quantitative validity of the online sensor measurements has been assessed by statistical analysis (t-test) and reported in the paper. Online data, acquired every 30 min, availability is of extreme importance for the CW system performance optimization, for understanding the behavior of the WWTP in different operative scenarios, and finally for driving the powering on or off eventual process enhancement tools. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'Urban surface runoff strongly contributes to the degradation of river ecosystems. Innovative and nature-based solutions have been applied to face such environmental problems. In this regard, constructed wetlands – a low-cost green treatment technology – represent a successful example of a solution that results in social and environmental benefits. Constructed floating wetlands (CFW) is a relatively new water treatment technique that consists of emergent macrophytes planted on floating structures. The CFW has been tested for the treatment of wastewater and stormwater runoff. However, few studies assess the system’s capability over short periods of retention time and its performance under hydraulic shock-loading. This research reports the performance of CFW applied to treatment of simulated urban surface runoff. The removal efficiency of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) was investigated for two macrophyte species: Typha domingensis and Schoenoplectus californicus. Total organic carbon, wet biomass, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, oxygen reduction potential (ORP), conductivity, temperature and turbidity were also measured. A commercial floating structure without growth medium was employed. The experiment utilized batch mesocosms, first with a seven-day retention time and second, under hydraulic shock-loading with 24, 2, and 4 h retention times. Differences between treatments and controls were analysed by PERMANOVA and ANOSIM tests. The results for a seven-day batch indicated that T. domingensis was more efficient than S. californicus (removal efficiency of TP = 47 %, TN = 78 % and TP = 11 %, TN = 30 %, respectively). There was a significant difference in nutrient removal for retention times of 24 h and 4 h for T. domingensis. No significant nutrient removal was noticed for S. californicus when the retention time was less than seven days. © Asociación Ibérica de Limnología, Madrid. Spain.',\n",
       " 'Deforestation, intensive farming and the sealing of green spaces are considered to be the main reasons for the global decrease of biodiversity. In this context, the built environment, and in particular vertical surfaces, are still highly underestimated and need to be taken into account. Although it is acknowledged that greened surfaces have beneficial effects, for example, on the microclimate, the vast majority of buildings are still not biodiversity-friendly. Artificial nesting boxes help birds and bats adapt to the change of their habitats. However, insects, with their tremendous significance for insectivorous species and for humans, are mostly neglected or even threatened. The purpose of this holistic approach is to investigate interactions between integrated insect habitat systems in facades and building physical aspects to create test objects. Heat transfer coefficients, thermal bridges, and the risk of condensation inside the buildings were simulated in different arrangements of nesting boxes for wild bees. As a result, conclusions on heat and humidity protection in ventilated facades and external thermal insulation composite systems could be drawn. The following results showed the maintenance of indoor comfort and energy efficiency as well as a low risk of mold. Further investigations analyzed the sound reduction index and fire protection. From a building physical point of view, integrated insect habitat systems could be part of the constructed environment and even link inner-city biotopes. Further challenges and opportunities are identified rather at a socio-ecological and technical level. Without taking into account the civil society and ecological demands of the various species, habitat systems for insects will miss their objectives. Special focus will be put on the skepticism and lack of knowledge of people, as well as on the comfort of the insects. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Nature-based-solutions (NBS) pursue a combination of economic, social, and environmental benefits that can meet municipal goals on stormwater and rapid urbanization problems. However, NBS have fallen behind in reaching to the political and legal framework, and with this, to a policy mix for urban stormwater sustainability. When looking closer at NBS, it becomes evident that they are loaded with many barriers, including institutional and political ones, as well as those that exist in the urban area social context. These barriers are also deepened by the lack of policy guidelines and few demonstration projects. In this respect, this paper combines the concepts of urban experiments and the policy feedback cycle (PFC) into a singular assessment tool. It's goal is to assess Costa Rica's municipal readiness in the implementation of NBS within the context of policy design and implementation. Therefore, this paper focusses on the first two stages of the PFC of an existing urban experiment to extract its policy insights for the successful replication of NBS projects. This novel method aims to contribute to the ongoing debate with respect to the ability of experimentation to prompt scalability and transferability of results. Hence, the New York City Green Infrastructure plan is considered as an urban experiment that promotes sustainable policy initiatives; while the PFC can identify and (re)formulate these policies initiatives and barriers into an adaptable policy guideline. Results indicate that sustainability policies at the municipal level should incorporate incentive mechanisms policies on (i) community involvement and communication; and (ii) transdisciplinary knowledge transfer between specialists and stakeholders. Finally, this paper suggests the inter-municipal cross-institutional collaboration and the recognition of external trigger events to incentivize a sustainable urban transition. © 2019 by the authors.\",\n",
       " 'Urbanization of stream ecosystems with the purpose of managing the flash-flood events is nowadays considered responsible for habitat loss and alteration of the natural flow regime with severe implications for the ecosystem functioning. Unsurprisingly, the river scientists have started seeking alternative options inspired from nature for mitigating the flood-risk and maintaining the stream at its natural state. With this article the authors demonstrate the effects of a nature-based solution (NBS) for managing an urban stream based on the use of bioengineering materials (e.g. plants) and the implementation of the actions that restore the stream to its natural form (e.g channel widening). The HEC-RAS software was employed to simulate the flow and hydraulic components of an approximately 800m long reach of an urban stream under three different scenarios of flood risk management with a design flow set to 400 m3/s. The first scenario was based on the current situation of the stream, the second scenario concerned the stream restoration by following the nature-based solutions, while the third scenario was based on the classical \"grey\" engineering approach of concrete channelization. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry methods and the Pix4Dmapper software were used in order to develop a detailed 3D model of the studied reach that accurately captured the current geomorphology. The obtained results showed that with concrete channelization, the average and maximum flow of the stream increases significantly in relation to the current situation, from 2.48 and 4.88m/s to 9.82 and 11.22 m/s, respectively, while the average Froude number raises from 0.36 to 1.69 implying super-critical flows. In contrast, the NBS scenario retained lower flow velocities and average Froude number similar to those under the current conditions. In addition, a cost estimation analysis for both stream management techniques revealed that the NBS is much cheaper than the traditional channelization (1.1 mil € vs 5.6 mil €). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the future restoration of urban streams should consider the nature-based solutions since i) they can be effective with regard to the reduction of flood-risk, ii) are cheaper than the traditional \"grey\" techniques and, most importantly, iii) maintain the natural state of the ecosystem which improves not only the ecosystem functioning but also the aesthetic value within the urban context. © 2020 Polish Society of Ecological Engineering (PTIE).',\n",
       " 'This work investigates the possibility of implementing a nature-based solution (NBS) based on the photosynthetic process of Laurus nobilis L. (common laurel), for reducing peak CO2 concentrations in an air-tight museum environment, namely the Refectory of the Santa Maria delle Grazie Church (Milan, Italy), home of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s painting \"Last Supper\". The phytoremediation potential of laurel plants was evaluated at CO2 ≅ 1000 ppm under controlled environmental conditions. Furthermore, light-saturated net assimilation (Pnmax) was measured at two CO2 concentrations (380 and 1000 ppm) during the growing season. Steady-state gas exchanges were not affected by elevated CO2 in the short-term, while Pnmax was significantly increased, also showing higher values in spring and autumn, and a reduction during summer. Our estimated CO2 removal rates indicate that, in order to control visitors\\' respiratory CO2 emissions in view of an increase in visitor numbers in the Refectory, a possible NBS in the form of an external greenhouse, connected to the HVAC system of the museum, should allocate from 58 to 112 young laurel plants, depending on their seasonal phytoremediation capacity. These results, although preliminary, allow to hypothesize the possibility of controlling CO2 indoors through a combination of traditional air-cleaning systems and a properly designed NBS, thus increasing the sustainability of air-tight museum environments. © 2020 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'The European Union quickly incorporated the concept of nature based-solutions (NBS), becoming a key promotor. This was achieved through financial support for both academic research and city implementations. Still, the processes of institutionalization are yet to be fully explored. This study aims at assessing how the scientific literature regarding NBS is addressing institutional aspects and how it is constructing the NBS narrative. This research is divided into two stages. First, it undertakes a quantitative analysis of the discourse, considering a set of preselected search terms organized into five categories: Actor, institutional, planning, policy, and regulation. Second, it adopts a qualitative analysis considering both a group of the most cited articles and of articles highlighted in the previous stage. The results indicate that the NBS concept is still shadowed by other environmental concepts such as ecosystem services. Despite being an issue promoted at the European level, the results of this exercise express the lack of concrete planning and policy recommendations, reflected by the absence of terms such as \"planning objectives\". This pattern occurs in all other major categories, being the institutional category the least mentioned of all five categories. The results highlight the need to address both policies and planning recommendations more concretely, studying the institutional arrangements able to promote NBS. © 2019 by the authors.

       " \"Ecosystem services are commonly defined as the benefits received by humanity via functioning ecosystems. They can be broadly categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and habitat services; with many services co-occurring and most ecosystems providing a wide range of services across several categories. Water mediates many ecosystem services and is in turn heavily influenced by land management decisions made at different scales from local to basin. Taking a holistic ecosystem services approach that focuses on maintaining healthy ecosystems as primary mechanisms for ensuring sustainable services delivery has been slowly mainstreamed into land management decision making worldwide. In addition, it is now often an important guiding principle in research for development programs. In many water-rich basins found in less developed countries, efforts are under way to increase energy resources via hydropower production as well as expand irrigation potential to increase food security. However, climate change threatens to undermine these goals - meant to spur development and alleviate poverty - by imposing risks and requiring decision makers to act under significant levels of uncertainty. Within Kenya, the Tana River Basin serves as an example where there are significant development targets for hydropower, domestic water provision, and irrigation; planned as part of Kenya's 2030 Vision. Currently, the basin supplies Nairobi with hydropower and nearly all of its domestic water resources through a series of water transfers and dams in the Upper Tana Basin. Historically, authorities have struggled to develop sustainable large-scale irrigation projects in the middle and lower basin, while the upper basin continues to be one of the most agriculturally productive regions within the country. Both hydropower production and irrigation expansion have been plagued by controversy with historical efforts leading to relocations and increased conflict. At present, the country is working to balance its need for water, energy, and food security with the preservation of ecosystems and ensuring the sustainability of the services they provide. The basin is home to two major biodiversity hot spots. At its headwaters, the Kenyan government actively manages the Afromontane forests of the Aberdare Mountain Range, which serves as one of Kenya's five main water towers by ensuring water quantity and quality of the waters supplied to downstream users. At the terminus of the Tana River, lies its rich delta providing numerous livelihood opportunities as well as supporting several endemic and endangered plant and animal species. There are critical concerns regarding how hydropower and irrigation development may affect this rich delta. In addition, alarms have been raised regarding how upstream land management practices may have deleterious effects on current and planned built infrastructure (e.g., hydropower and large-scale irrigation) in the basin. Under the WISE-UP to Climate project, natural infrastructure is explored as a 'nature-based solution' for climate change adaptation and sustainable development. The project is developing knowledge on how to use portfolios of built water infrastructure (e.g., dams, levees, and irrigation channels) and natural infrastructure (e.g., wetlands, floodplains, and watersheds) in tandem for poverty reduction, water-energy-food security, biodiversity conservation, and climate resilience. This paper presents a basin-scale summary of natural resources within the Tana River Basin and illustrates an overview of how people living within the basin rely on a wide variety of ecosystem services. In addition, the paper puts forth a first approximation of the key role natural infrastructure plays in supporting efforts to ensure water-energy-food security in the Tana River Basin. © 2012, by IWMI.\",\n",

A quantitative approach was employed to achieve study objectives. Our findings from the structural analysis indicated that green spaces as nature-based solution significantly influence psychological resilience. In addition, such relationship contributes to increasing positive attitude, strengthening brand-self connection and brand prominence, and building traveler retention. A salient role of attitude in determining retention was found. A further analysis (metric invariance) revealed that the linkage from green spaces to psychological resilience was moderated by hotel price reasonableness, and the association became stronger when guests feel that hotel price is reasonable. Overall, this research successfully verified the importance of a hotel’s green spaces and its role in guest psychological and affective responses and behaviors. © 2019 by the author.

       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) is the latest contribution to the green concept family. NBS is defined as actions based in nature addressing societal challenges. In this study, we lean on the concept boundary object, broken down into three analytical categories: use, core ideas and granularities, to explore the cohesive and fragmenting powers of the NBS concept, and discuss its future role in green space governance. The study is based on a structured, qualitative review of 112 scientific peer-reviewed publications that use the term NBS. Most publications are from 2017 or later, highlighting the novelty of the NBS concept. The concept has a strong footing in the European urban context. Flood mitigation and functional ecosystems and biodiversity conservation are the most targeted sustainability goals in the publications, and a diversity of solutions are considered. There is a close link between the NBS concept, green infrastructure, and the ecosystem service concept, indicating a path dependency in its uptake and use. The publications demonstrate a low level of integration of the NBS concept (i.e. it is commonly used as a buzz word). Most empirical studies focus solely on environmental benefits delivered by NBS, and few studies assess social, economic, and environmental benefits together, which is a central ambition of the concept. We conclude that the NBS concept is working on the boundaries between different scientific disciplines and between science and policy. Depending on how the research community deals with identified temporal, epistemological and ontological granularities, we conclude that the concept has three potential developmental pathways; broader and deeper, biased with stickiness to older green concepts and an empty buzz word. © 2019 The Authors',\n",
       " \"The concept of a nature-based solution (NBS) has been developed in order to operationalize an ecosystem services approach within spatial planning policies and practices, to fully integrate the ecological dimension, and, at the same time, to address current societal challenges in cities. It exceeds the bounds of traditional approaches that aim 'to protect and preserve' by considering enhancing, restoring, co-creating, and co-designing urban green networks with nature that are characterized by multifunctionality and connectivity. NBSs include the main ideas of green and blue infrastructure, ecosystem services, and biomimicry concepts, and they are considered to be urban design and planning tools for ecologically sensitive urban development. Nowadays, NBSs are on their way to the mainstream as part of both national and international policies. The successful implementation of NBSs in Europe and worldwide, which is becoming increasingly common, highlights the importance and relevance of NBS for sustainable and livable cities. This paper discusses the roles, development processes, and functions of NBSs in cities by taking Leipzig as a case study. Using data from interviews conducted from 2017 to 2019, we study the past and current challenges that the city faces, including the whole process of NBS implementation and successful realization. We discuss the main drivers, governance actors, and design options of NBSs. We highlight the ecosystem services provided by each NBS.We discuss these drivers and governance strategies by applying the framework for assessing the co-benefits of NBSs in urban areas in order to assess the opportunities and challenges that NBSs may have. This way, we are able to identify steps and procedures that help to increase the evidence base for the effectiveness of NBS by providing examples of best practice that demonstrate the multiple co-benefits provided by NBSs. © 2020 by the authors.\",\n",
       " 'Scholars and practitioners are increasingly promoting so-called nature-based approaches for urban climate change adaptation. There is widespread consensus that they both support and require transdisciplinary approaches, notably by involving citizens in the change process and finding innovative ways to unite different actors’ efforts and capacities. However, there is little empirical evidence regarding the actual value of citizen involvement to sustainability in this field. Against this background, this paper examines whether (or not) current forms and conditions of citizen involvement help to create a platform to support nature-based solutions and ensure a transformative adaptation process. The results show that under current conditions, citizen engagement often hampers sustainable outcomes. In fact, current structures and mechanisms for mainstreaming nature and climate considerations into sectoral planning are limited and, furthermore, neglect citizen involvement. In addition, there is a blind spot with respect to personal spheres of transformation toward sustainability regarding citizens, civil servants, and decision-makers. Key constraints are power structures and the lack of cognitive/emotional and relational capacities required for improved democratic governance. If we are to tap into the potential of nature-based solutions to increase climate adaptation governance, we need targeted financial and human resources, and greater capacity to overcome current constraints and support all levels and phases of mainstreaming, notably planning, implementation, monitoring, and learning. © 2019, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Nature Based Solutions (NBS) are currently gaining importance in the EU policy agenda as a promising approach to mitigate and adapt to environmental and climate change.

The classification scheme is presented as a matrix and contains a portfolio of known NBS as well as the important criteria for their selection. Specifically, we have included disservices/ barriers, and the potential impacts of climate change on NBS. The matrix provides decision-makers with a tool that will guide them through the first phase of the complex process when choosing the most appropriative NBS for a specific challenge.

       " 'Elevated trace metal concentrations in sediments pose a major problem for the management of stormwater detention basins. These basins provide a nature-based solution to remove particulate pollutants through settling, but the resuspension of these contaminated deposits may impact the quality of both surface and groundwater. A better understanding of trace metal distribution will help to improve basin design and sediment management. This study aims to predict the distribution of trace metal contamination in a stormwater detention basin through (i) investigation of the correlation between metal content in sediments and their settling velocity, and (ii) the coupling of such correlation with a Lagrangian Discrete Phase Model (LDPM). The correlation between Fe, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb contents and the settling velocity is firstly investigated, based on the sediments collected from 6 sites (inlet and 5 traps at the bottom of a detention basin situated in Chassieu, France) during 5 campaigns in 2017. Results show that Fe is strongly correlated to settling velocity and can be considered as a good indicator of trace metal contents. The derived correlation is then combined with a LDPM for the prediction of trace metal distribution, producing results consistent with in situ measurements. The proposed methodology can be applied for other stormwater basins (dry or wet). As described in this article, the interactions between hydrodynamics and sediment physico-chemical characteristics is crucial for the design and management of stormwater detention basins, allowing managers to target the highest contaminated sediments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'In agricultural lands, the way in which slope position affects the detachment of material and the runoff generation is not clear. There are complex interactions between slope position, slope gradient and a series of soil characteristics, and their impact on runoff generation and soil erosion may vary from site to site. We designed an experiment to investigate the initial hydrological responces of soils located on different slope positions (footslope, backslope and shoulder) in runoff and soil detachment generation. To achieve these goals, 25 high-intensity low frequency rainfall events were simulated in experiments with a return period of 5 years, on 0.25 m2 circular plots to measure the detachment along a hillslope in the Celler del Roure vineyards in Eastern Spain. The results of this investigation showed that soil erosion rates (3 Mg ha−1 h−1) were high and there were no significant differences between sites in relation to slope position; all the plots generated runoff (runoff coefficient of 24.8%). These results allow us to conclude that soil detachment and runoff generation in Mediterranean vineyards, where tillage is millennia-old management practice, could be also evenly distributed. Therefore, the used management practices in these vineyards contribute to creating net source areas of runoff and erosion with no areas that could act as a sink under intensive rainfall events. Based on our research and a literature review, we propose to implement nature-based solutions that would contribute to reducing soil erosion in agricultural land by creating sink areas in the form of hedgerows, ponds, or vegetation strips where the surface wash deposits and water can sediment and infiltrate. We also discussed other management practices contributing to reduction of erosion,such as mulching and inter-row crops. We state that there is an urgent need to apply strategies to reduce soil loss in vineyards. © 2019 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences',\n",

Though extensively studied, most field experiments reflect the performance of these systems in temperate and cold climates and in relatively controlled flow conditions. This study aims at evaluating the performance of a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland using indigenous macrophytes in a tropical climate (i.e., in East Africa, Ethiopia) under suboptimal conditions of flow. Two selected plant species, i.e., Cyperus papyrus (papyrus) and Scirpus validus (bulrush) were tested using the wastewater from a dormitory at Jimma University Campus in Ethiopia. The experimental period consisted of two (rather) well controlled phases with two non-controlled and non-sampled phases and one intentional disturbance phase in between. BOD5 removal was 81% in papyrus, 76% in bulrush and 48% in Control. TSS removal was 76% and 75% in papyrus and bulrush compared to 54% in the control. COD removal showed 65% and 62% in the planted beds and 32% in the control. TSS removal demands more controlled operations than other parameters. It was concluded that CWs can function well under irregular flow conditions and can be the technology of choice in low income countries particularly in tropical climates. © 2019 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences',\n",
       " \"A growing number of cities are investing in green infrastructure to foster urban resilience and sustainability. While these nature-based solutions are often promoted on the basis of their multifunctionality, in practice, most studies and plans focus on a single benefit, such as stormwater management. This represents a missed opportunity to strategically site green infrastructure to leverage social and ecological co-benefits. To address this gap, this paper builds on existing modeling approaches for green infrastructure planning to create a more generalizable tool for comparing spatial tradeoffs and synergistic 'hotspots' for multiple desired benefits. I apply the model to three diverse coastal megacities: New York City, Los Angeles (United States), and Manila (Philippines), enabling cross-city comparisons for the first time. Spatial multi-criteria evaluation is used to examine how strategic areas for green infrastructure development across the cities change depending on which benefit is prioritized. GIS layers corresponding to six planning priorities (managing stormwater, reducing social vulnerability, increasing access to green space, improving air quality, reducing the urban heat island effect, and increasing landscape connectivity) are mapped and spatial tradeoffs assessed. Criteria are also weighted to reflect local stakeholders' desired outcomes as determined through surveys and stakeholder meetings and combined to identify high priority areas for green infrastructure development. To extend the model's utility as a decision-support tool, an interactive web-based application is developed that allows any user to change the criteria weights and visualize the resulting hotspots in real time. The model empirically illustrates the complexities of planning green infrastructure in different urban contexts, while also demonstrating a flexible approach for more participatory, strategic, and multifunctional planning of green infrastructure in cities around the world. © 2019 The Author(s).

       " 'Due to the fact that urban environments and population demands are evolving rapidly and species selection is inevitable, it is possible to gain substantial environmental benefit by implementing more effective urban tree planting programs, especially with the aim of increasing the upcoming provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) through proper species selection. In this paper, we used a new approach to improve the potential of urban trees in optimizing more desirable environmental benefits. This was done by selecting the most appropriate tree species among a vast range of species based on their potential environmental function (both services and disservices) in Tabriz city, Iran. Also, three main planting scenarios (divided to six sub-scenarios) were developed so as to understand the long-term effectiveness of introducing the selected tree species in improving the environmental benefits (both urban forest structure and ES) in comparison with planting the existing tree species. The results indicate that regardless of the quantity of planting, the benefits of introducing the selected trees will be more than planting the existing species. Moreover, as the amount of the annual planting of the recommended species increases, so does the improvement in the projected tree characteristics and ES. This approach creates more opportunities which enable urban forest managers and policymakers to understand the importance of selecting the proper urban tree species when looking for a nature-based solution to promote the wellbeing of the urban population, to create more livable and ecologically sustainable cities and to mitigate urban environmental problems. © 2019, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions (NBS) are solutions that can protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems in urban and rural areas, while providing many benefits and co-benefits including stormwater mitigation, biodiversity enhancement, and human well-being. As such, NBS have the potential to alleviate many of the environmental, social, and economic issues that we face today. Grey infrastructure, such as lined trenches and catch basins, pipes, and concrete dikes are frequently used for stormwater management and flood protection, but they do not provide many of the co-benefits that are common with NBS. Grey infrastructure is designed to quickly collect and remove rainwater, whereas NBS keep rainwater where it falls, and where it can be used by the environment. Many stakeholders lack knowledge of the capabilities and benefits of NBS, and as a result, they continue to rely on grey infrastructure in their projects. When information is made available on the benefits and how they can be quantitatively measured, it is hoped that NBS will be promoted to a mainstream infrastructure choice. A valuable way to quantify and highlight the benefits of NBS is by using an evaluation framework. There are several evaluation frameworks that qualitatively assess the potential benefits of possible NBS, however there is a need for quantitative frameworks that can assess the actual benefits (or performance) of implemented (or existing) NBS. This article presents an evaluation framework that aims to quantify the benefits and co-benefits of implemented NBS. The framework involves five main steps: (1) selection of NBS benefit categories, (2) selection of NBS indicators, (3) calculation of indicator values, (4) calculation of NBS grade, and (5) recommendations. The outcome of the framework is a single numerical grade that reflects the benefit functioning for an NBS site and values for each performance indicator. This information may be used by decision makers to determine their budget allocations to expand or construct a new NBS site, to update maintenance plans that will improve the benefits of that site, to set up programs to monitor the NBS benefits and co-benefits over time, and to schedule labour and resources for other NBS projects. The framework was tested and validated on a case study of NBS in Thailand. Through conversations with stakeholders and knowledge of the case study area, relevant categories and indicators were chosen. Using data and information obtained through various means, values for each indicator and the overall NBS grade were calculated. The values revealed which benefits were pronounced, those that were weak, and where improvements were required. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",

       " 'This paper describes a large-scale experiment designed to examine if reinstating natural processes in the coastal dune systems of Southwest France can be a relevant nature-based adaptation in chronically eroding sectors and a nature-based solution against coastal hazards, by maintaining the coastal dune ecological corridor. An experiment started in late 2017 on a 4-km-long stretch of coast at Truc Vert, where experimental notches were excavated and intensively monitored in the incipient and established foredunes. Preliminary results indicate that most of the excavated notches did not develop into blowout. Only the larger elongated notches subsequently excavated in the established foredune in 2018 showed evidence of development, acting as an effective conduit for aeolian landward transport into the dunes. All notches were found to have a statistically significant impact on vegetation dynamics downwind, even those that did not develop. The area of bare sand landward and within the elongated notches notably increased implying a loss of vegetation cover during this first stage of development. Observations of a nearby coastal dune system that has been in free evolution over the last 40 years also indicate that, although the dune migrated inland by more than 100 m, it is now mostly made of bare sand. Further work is required to explore if and how dunes maintained as dynamic systems can become an efficient nature-based solution along this eroding coastline. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'Nowadays, it is better understood that the benefits of green infrastructure include a series of ecosystem services, such as cooling, water storage and management, recreation and landscaping, among others. Green technologies are still developing to provide sustainable solutions to the problems that modern cities and peri-urban areas face at an ever-increasing rate and intensity. Constructed wetlands technology is an established green multi-purpose option for water management and wastewater treatment, with numerous effectively proven applications around the world and multiple environmental and economic advantages. These systems can function as water treatment plants, habitat creation sites, urban wildlife refuges, recreational or educational facilities, landscape engineering and ecological art areas. The aim of this article is to highlight the synergies between this green technology and urban areas in order to reconnect cities with nature, to promote circularity in the urban context and to apply innovative wetland designs as landscape infrastructure and water treatment solutions. This approach could be a step further in the effort to mitigate the current degradation process of the urban landscape. Following the concept of green infrastructure, the article presents and suggests ways to integrate wetland technology in the urban environment, namely: (i) stormwater and urban runoff management (storage and treatment of water during storm events) to provide protection from flood incidents, especially considering climate change, (ii) innovative low-impact infrastructure and design solutions for urban wastewater treatment, and (iii) wetland technology for habitat creation and ecosystem services provision. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'Cities face increasing environmental, social and economic challenges that together threaten the resilience of urban areas and the residents who live and work there. These challenges include chronic stresses and acute shocks, amplified by climate change impacts. Nature-based solutions have emerged as a concept for integrating ecosystem-based approaches to address a range of societal challenges. Nature-based solutions directly address and contribute to increased urban resilience. However, implementing nature-based solutions is inherently complex, given the range of ecosystem services, their multi-functionality and the trade-offs between functions, and across temporal and spatial scales. Urban planning can play a substantial role to support the implementation of nature-based solutions and to manage trade-offs and conflicts, as well as how social equity dimensions are considered. This paper presents a framework that guides the application of urban planning to nature-based solutions’ implementation, by addressing key trade-offs across temporal, spatial, functional and social equity aspects. The framework highlights the key questions, and the supporting information required to address these questions, to underpin the inclusion of nature-based solutions for urban resilience. We find that while urban planning can contribute substantially, there are continuing gaps in how the inherently anthropocentric urban planning processes can give voice to non-human nature. © 2019 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Urban heat island (UHI) effect has serious negative impacts on urban ecosystems and human well-being. Mitigation of UHI using nature-based solutions is highly desirable. It was well known that urban green infrastructure (UGI), i.e., urban vegetation, can effectively mitigate UHI effect. However, the potential of urban blue infrastructure (UBI), i.e., urban surface water, on UHI mitigation is not well understood, although its potential to lower UHI effect via evaporation is similar to the biophysical mechanism of evapotranspiration through vegetation. In this paper, we study the relationship between UBI and land surface temperature (LST) in Wuhan city in central China, using a normalized difference water index (NDWI), maximum local cool island intensity and the maximum cooling distance as indicators for the cooling effects of UBI, respectively. We found a significant negative linear relationship between mean LST and NDWI after NDWI passes a critical threshold value. NDWI is an effective biophysical parameter to delineate the spatial distribution of UBI. The cooling effects of UBI are influenced both by its size and shape. Water surface temperature decreased logarithmically with increasing UBI size, critical threshold values of UBI size corresponding to maximum cooling efficiency do exists. Maximum cooling distance and maximum local cool island intensity are also affected by the shape and size of UBI, and exhibit seasonal and spatial variations. These results provide insights for urban landscape planning regarding how to use UBI as a nature-based solution to improve urban thermal environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

       " 'There is substantial, growing literature that details positive human health effects, psychological and physiological, of exposure to “nature,” including “green” and “blue space,” with evidence suggesting that diversity of species or environments may have specific positive human health benefits. These health benefits are important ecosystem services provided by healthy ecosystems. In this paper, we discuss several critical ecosystem services provided by wetlands including disaster risk reduction, with an emphasis on benefits to human health and well-being. Impacts to human health via damage to ecosystem services from disasters have rarely been considered in disaster planning or mitigation, nor have the health benefits been part of the framework for planning urban greenspaces and land-use. Coastal wetlands can be part of “natural and nature-based” solutions, minimizing the impacts of disasters by buffering coastal communities from storms and erosion and absorbing flood waters. In addition, mental and physical health benefits of experiencing healthy wetlands could offset some stress and disease encounters related to disasters. Thus, coastal wetlands should be part of a strategy for reducing the risk posed by disasters and facilitating recovery. We conclude with recommendations for research priorities and specific inclusion of wetlands in coastal community planning for disaster response and recovery. © 2018, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'With climate change, coastal areas are faced with unprecedented sea level rise and flooding, raising questions as to how societies will choose to adapt. One option is to strengthen existing sea walls to maintain current land uses; however, scientists, policy-makers and conservationists increasingly see the benefits of managed realignment, which is a nature-based coastal adaptation that involves the conversion of reclaimed farmland back to wetlands, allowing periodic local flooding in designated areas to reduce the risk of flooding downstream. We interviewed 16 local organisations, landowners and farmers and held workshops with 109 citizens living the Inner Forth estuary in eastern Scotland, to examine how managed realignment is supported by stakeholder attitudes and their engagement. Most of the farmers we interviewed prefer strengthened sea walls, to maintain their livelihoods and agricultural heritage. Citizens and local organisations were mainly supportive of managed realignment, because it provided wildlife and flood regulation benefits. However, we identified several barriers that could present obstacles to implementing managed realignment, for example, uncertainty whether it would support their principles of economic and rational decision-making. Our findings suggest that the local capacity to cope with rising sea levels is limited by lack of engagement with all relevant stakeholder groups, the limited scope of existing stakeholder partnerships and poor short-term funding prospects of landscape partnerships that would facilitate collaboration and discussion. We suggest that including citizens, landowners, farmers and industries would strengthen existing stakeholder deliberation and collaboration, and support the Inner Forth’s transition towards a more sustainable future shoreline. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'There is an imperative worldwide need to identify effective approaches to deal with water-related risks, and mainly with increasingly frequent floods, as well as with severe droughts. Particularly, policy and decision-makers are trying to identify systemic strategies that, going beyond the mere risk reduction, should be capable to deal simultaneously with multiple challenges (such as climate resilience, health and well-being, quality of life), thus providing additional benefits. In this direction, the contribution of Nature Based Solutions (NBS) is relevant, although their wider implementation is still hampered by several barriers, such as the uncertainty and lack of information on their long-term behavior and the difficulty of quantitatively valuing their multidimensional impacts. The activities described in the present paper, carried out within the EU funded project NAIAD, mainly aim at developing a participatory System Dynamic Model capable to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of NBS to deal with flood risks, while producing a multiplicity of co-benefits. The adoption of a participatory approach supported both to increase the available knowledge and the awareness about the potential of NBS and hybrid measures (e.g. a combination of NBS and socio-institutional ones).

       " 'As a consequence of climate change and urbanization, many cities will have to deal with more flooding and extreme heat stress. This paper presents a framework to maximize the effectiveness of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for flood risk reduction and thermal comfort enhancement. The framework involves an assessment of hazards with the use of models and field measurements. It also detects suitable implementation sites for NBS and quantifies their effectiveness for thermal comfort enhancement and flood risk reduction. The framework was applied in a densely urbanized study area, for which different small-scale urban NBS and their potential locations for implementation were assessed. The overall results show that the most effective performance in terms of flood mitigation and thermal comfort enhancement is likely achieved by applying a range of different measures at different locations. Therefore, the work presented here shows the potential of the framework to achieve an effective combination of measures and their locations, which was demonstrated on the case of the Sukhumvit area in Bangkok (Thailand). This can be particularly suitable for assessing and planning flood mitigation measures in combination with heat stress reduction. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly being considered as an option to reduce societies' vulnerability to natural hazards, creating co-benefits while protecting ecosystem services in a context of changing climate patterns with more frequent and extreme weather events. The reinsurance and insurance industries are increasingly cited as sectors that can play a role to help manage risks, by improving disaster risk reduction (DRR) and loss prevention. This paper investigates how the (re)insurance industry could support the transition from a paradigm focused on ex-post responses to ex-ante risk reduction measures including NBS, in line with the Sendai Framework. This paper presents the results of a series of 61 interviews undertaken with the (re)insurance sector and related actors under the EU H2020 Nature Insurance Value Assessment and Demonstration (NAIAD) project. Methods based on a Grounded Theory approach indicate how this sector can play different roles in loss prevention, including ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (eco-DRR). Results illustrate how the (re)insurance industry, under these roles, is gradually innovating by having a better understanding of hazards and mitigation.

We offer a straightforward and educational protocol targeted for effectiveness analysis and decision making involving stakeholder participation. It is based on the concept of flood-excess volume (FEV), the volume exceeding a threshold and generating flood damage, and explores what fraction of FEV is reduced, and at what cost, by particular flood-mitigation measures. Quantification and interpretation of cost scenarios are facilitated using a graphical display that is easy to understand and encapsulates concepts of flood magnitude, FEV and protection-measures efficacy. It is exemplified for two recent extreme-flood events on the River Calder in Mytholmroyd (Yorkshire, United Kingdom) and the River Brague in Biot (Alpes-Maritimes, France). Each case has different flood-mitigation measures such as natural water-retention measures, tree planting, river-bed widening, or use of reservoirs and floods walls. Our straightforward protocol enables fast, quantifiable and easy-to-understand exploration of protection strategies using multiple measures, and in doing so highlights the issue of NBS scalability. © 2019 The Authors.

       " 'Nature-based solutions to insurance are in high demand. We explore the idea that natural capital has an insurance value insofar as it can mitigate the effects of uncertainty on human well-being. We present a formal model that substantiates this claim. We propose a definition for the insurance value of natural capital for a stochastic and dynamic ecosystem that provides ecosystem services for a risk-averse user. The insurance value of natural capital depends on the properties of ecosystem dynamics as well as on the risk and time preferences of the ecosystem user. It can be positive or negative. We relate the natural insurance value to conservative use of the ecosystem and precautionary investment in the natural capital stock. For the case of logarithmic per-period utility we find that optimal management becomes more conservative with increasing uncertainty if and only if the insurance value of natural capital is positive. We qualify this finding for more general forms of the per-period utility function. © 2019 The Authors',\n",
       " \"In the context of climate change and rapid urbanization, pluvial flooding has posed an increasing challenge for urban sustainability and drawn research attention to better understanding the role of an ecosystem's flood regulation service (EFRS) in mitigating floods. However, relatively little is known about the supply and demand of the EFRS at the city scale and about the effect of nature-based solutions on the EFRS. To fill this gap, we present an integrated method to calculate the EFRS supply as the difference between precipitation and runoff using hydrology models and the EFRS demand as the expected flood damages through flood risk analysis. The spatial relationship between the supply and demand of the EFRS is analyzed using spatial statistics. A case study in central Shanghai, China, shows that the total EFRS demand is US$ 1.14 billion for a 100-year pluvial flood, with the demand density decreasing from the west to the east. The total EFRS supply is 2.14 × 107 m3, with the supply density increasing from the center and to the periphery. The EFRS supply and demand are imbalanced, as the demand is relatively higher than the supply in 92 (or 32.86%) catchments. Three of these imbalanced catchments can potentially be satisfied through inter-catchment EFRS sharing from neighboring catchments with abundant supplies of the EFRS. The number of imbalanced catchments can also be reduced to 27–42 by adopting concave green lands. The proposed methods have a broad application in other cities around the world. These findings could facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the EFRS at the city scale and help policy-makers formulate an integrated flood risk management strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'The reduction of diffused nutrient pollution from agriculture is one of the defining challenges of our time, demanding system solutions. A nitrogen and phosphorus (N&P) reduction strategy at the catchment scale is the most realistic and effective long-term approach to eutrophication management. In this study, a voluntary programme for the reduction of diffuse pollution was developed for the Pilica catchment and the Sulejów Reservoir in Poland. The Action Plan was based on the ecohydrological approach, which strives to use ecosystem processes as a management tool. One fundamental element of the Plan was a SWAT model, used to estimate N&P emissions and to determine the priority areas in the catchment. Strong cooperation between water managers, interdisciplinary researchers, and stakeholders helped to catalyse the capacity-building process of public participation, through dialogical interaction including a critical exchange of knowledge. Finally, a list of selected spatially-targeted mitigation measures was generated based on the modelling results and following measure acceptance by stakeholders. The key assumption in the creation of the measure list was that ecohydrological nature-based solutions (NBS) should be used complementarily to good agricultural practices. Such an approach has contributed to a faster achievement of ‘good ecological status’ of water bodies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

They are known as Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia, Nature Based Solutions (NBS) in Europe, Low Impact Development (LID) in the USA, and Sponge City systems in China. Urban planning for WSUD has been ad-hoc, lacking strategy and resulting in sub-optimal outcomes. The purpose of this study is to help improve strategic WSUD planning and placement through the development of a Planning Support System. This paper presents the development of Spatial Suitability ANalysis TOol (SSANTO), a rapid GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis tool using a flexible mix of techniques to map suitability for WSUD assets across urban areas. SSANTO applies a novel WSUD suitability framework, which conceptualises spatial suitability for WSUD implementation from two perspectives: ‘Needs’ and ‘Opportunities’ for WSUD. It combines biophysical as well as socio-economic, planning and governance criteria (‘Opportunities’) with criteria relating to ecosystem services (‘Needs’). Testing SSANTO through comparing its results to work done by a WSUD consultancy successfully verified its algorithms and demonstrated its capability to reflect and potentially enhance the outcomes of planning processes. Manual GIS based suitability analysis is time and resource intensive. Through its rapid suitability analysis, SSANTO facilitates iterative spatial analysis for exploration of scenarios and stakeholder preferences. It thus facilitates collaborative planning and deeper understanding of the relationship between diverse and complex urban contexts and urban planning outcomes for WSUD. © 2019',\n",
       " 'Nature-based agriculture that reduces dependency on chemical inputs requires using ecological principles for sustainable agro-ecosystems, aiming to balance ecology, economics and social justice. There is growing evidence that pollinator-dependent crops with high insect, particularly bee, pollination service can give higher yields. However, the interacting effects between insect pollination and agricultural inputs on crop yields and farm economics remain to be established to reconcile food production with biodiversity conservation. We quantified individual and combined effects of pesticides, insect pollination and soil quality on oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) yield and gross margin, using a total of 294 farmers’ fields surveyed between 2013 and 2016. We show that yield and gross margins are greater (15–40%) in fields with higher pollinator abundance than in fields with reduced pollinator abundance. This effect is, however, strongly reduced by pesticide use. Greater yields may be achieved by either increasing agrochemicals or increasing bee abundance, but crop economic returns were only increased by the latter, because pesticides did not increase yields while their costs reduced gross margins. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

       " 'Public access to high quality green environments has become a key issue for city managers and a matter of environmental justice. Urban pressures on ecosystem remnants may act to favor the expansion of some invasive species in cities. Whilst the negative impacts of invasive species on ecosystem function is well documented, little is known about how invasive species influence the use of green space by people. Here, we examined one of the few remnants of urban riparian forests in Europe, the Vistula river valley inWarsaw, which has recently become an attractive recreation site. Despite their high ecological value, the poplar and willow forests have been increasingly taken over by the invasive tree species Acer negundo. We examined the status of the invasion process and the relationship between recreational ecosystem services and the characteristics of the tree stands-tree species, tree density, and age and NDVI values. We found the willow forest to be more susceptible to invasion by A. negundo than the poplar forest, which was revealed in significantly higher share of the maple individuals and their greater volume per unit area. Ash-leaved maples also prevailed in numbers in younger stands ( < 10 years) than in older ones. The presence of A. negundo affected biodiversity, resulting in decreased undergrowth density and biodiversity expressed in number of species. The use intensity by the public, assessed on the basis of soil compaction of existing informal tracks, as revealed by GLM analysis, was related to volume of invasive maple and distance from the main track. This study highlights the need to integrate invasive species management into green infrastructure planning and management. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",

The results show that, compared with private space, residents prefer to implement GI in public space, where they have different preferences of GI measures. On urban scale, residents\\' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI in private space is characterized as \"high in the inner city, low in the suburban areas\", while the spatial difference is insignificant for public space. In addition, the factors affecting residents\\' willingness to participate in the implementation of GI are different in private and public space. The deterministic factors of GI participation are gender, education level, and floor for private space, while only include building age for public space, in addition to the common factors of free time, cognition of GI, perception of pluvial flood risk, supportive factors, and environment-improving factors that can influence both private and public space GI participation.

       " \"Wetlands as oxbows play a fundamental socio-economic and environmental role. They behave as efficient tools in regards to hydrological and ecological concerns: they contribute to control rivers discharge (flood prevention and contribution to drought flow) as well as to manage water quality (excess nutrients retention) and they constitute refuge habitats for flora and fauna. They may so become more and more determinant as nature-based solutions in a near future. However, the establishment of complete and reliable functioning models is complicated by the different connection degrees that can present these specific wetlands to the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer. Moreover, monodisciplinary approaches usually conducted can underestimate or even neglect sources of water supply. The present study offers a multidisciplinary approach coupling hydrodynamic (surface water/groundwater levels), geochemical (T, EC, pH, major ions) and isotopic (δ2H-δ18O) characterization in order to properly assess the dynamic of these specific hydrosystems and so be able to establish a complete and reliable hydrodynamic conceptual model. The coupling approach has been tested on the Auzon Oxbow, one of the fluvial annexes of the Allier River (Massif Central, France). The resulting conceptual model testifies for connection degree higher that expected between the oxbow and both the main stream and alluvial aquifer. Indeed, a non-negligible supply of the oxbow by the alluvial groundwater is observed, especially in its downstream part. As this part of the oxbow is the site of its confluence to the Allier River, groundwater supply could have been underestimated. The geochemical approach shows that Allier River also supply the oxbow through the upstream paleochannel, result of a channel migration 30 years ago. Hydrodynamic and isotopic approaches complete the understanding showing that the paleochannel pathway is only active during high flow periods (from November to June). Based on these results, the strategic utility of the proposed approach to study oxbow's hydrosystems has been proved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'Constructed wetlands are designed to mitigate nutrient and pesticide fluxes from agricultural catchments. Nevertheless, information on their efficiency in removing non-degradable contaminants such as metals is still scarce. This study aimed to explore the metallic signature and fate of metals within the Rampillon wetland (France) receiving water from a drained 355-ha catchment under intensive agriculture. Original monitoring coupling classic, time-integrated and bioaccumulation-based tools was achieved to characterise spatiotemporal dynamics of various metals (As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se and Zn). To assess metal inflows and mitigation, samples of dissolved and particulate metals were collected bimonthly at the inlet and outlet of the wetland over 3 months. Simultaneously, time-integrated (sediment traps and passive samplers) and bioaccumulation-based (caged gammarids and biofilms) tools were deployed to monitor temporal changes in metal speciation and bioavailability. To gain insight into the spatial distribution of metals between abiotic and biotic matrices, sediments and indigenous invertebrates with contrasted ecologies were sampled in different cells of the wetland. The results showed time-integrated tools were more suitable than bimonthly samples to quantify metal mitigations because of temporal fluctuations and low contamination levels. Significant mitigations were thus observed in trapped sediments for all metals (ranged 11–23%, except Mn) as well as in the DGT-labile fraction for Cd, Cr, Co, Mn and Ni (ranged 13–51%). Bioaccumulation levels in biofilms also revealed a decrease in metal bioavailability at the outlet. Furthermore, the spatial survey supported the central role of sediments in metal trapping and the beneficial effect of this wetland for local biodiversity in terms of exposure. To conclude, this study provides valuable information on the ecodynamics and bioavailability of metals required for sustainable management of such artificial ecosystems and furthermore, of agricultural areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Three quarters of the European population live in urban areas, which is expected to increase to over 80% by 2050. The well-being of urban citizens appears to be closely linked to the correlation between the growth of urban areas and to the availability of green spaces. The conservation and the enhancement of the Green Infrastructure (GI) can be considered a Nature-Based Solution (NBS) to improve the sustainability of urban development. From this perspective, it is important to identify priority areas close to existing GIs suitable to be preserved from further urban encroachment. Our study aims to draw up a methodology to identify priority areas and, accordingly, to expand the GIs. The main objectives are: (i) to identify the most sensitive areas of the GI to be preserved from urban encroachment; (ii) to locate arable lands in the vacant border territories between GIs and built-up areas, that, if converted into connected elements, would enhance the connectivity of the existing GIs whilst limiting land take; (iii) to define an index of priorities for increasing the GI territory by means of NBSs, taking into account the variability of GI coverage and level of legal protection for nature conservation across different neighborhoods in the city. This approach is applied to the GIs of the 15 administrative units of the municipality of Rome (Italy) as a case study. First, we focus on Urban Atlas classes to map the GIs in the municipality. We then use Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis, implemented by a free software toolbox GUIDOS, to identify the key components of the GIs, such as hubs (core areas) and links (bridges). Then, a simulated new scenario is provided by including within the current GIs the agricultural lands outside protected areas, but within a buffer zone of 300\\xa0m from the land take. If the aforementioned agricultural lands, amounting to about 8000\\xa0ha, were converted into GI elements, they could lead to the improvement of connectivity and limit land take. Finally, in order to expand the area of the GIs, priority areas are selected within each administrative unit using an index based on the budget allocation process. The proposed methodology could be used: (i) by decision makers, looking for NBS in the design and planning of sustainable development of the city; and (ii) to enhance GI connectivity. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " \"Although construction of reservoirs and dams is one of the most common approaches to satisfy water demand and alleviate water scarcity, this approach severely affects river ecosystems. The most direct impact of human activities on rivers, for instance, regulating river can lead to degraded riverine ecosystems as part of the hydrological alteration. This paper determines the available ratio of water resource of natural or semi-natural rivers for ecological feasible regions using a method that transcends the traditional perspective of designed environmental flow. Our framework involves a modified percent of flow approach to identify the ecological feasible region of water resources utilization, which sequentially acts as a constraint for a reservoir optimization model based on the Cuckoo Search algorithm to obtain an optimal diversion process. Indicators of the hydrological alteration statistical method and the histogram matching approach are used to examine the framework's performance. The Han to Wei inter-basin water transfer project of China is selected as a case study. Results indicate that: (1) the allowable diversion rate with this modified percent of flow approach is more effective for reducing interference of diversion on the ecosystems than the conventional planned diversion rule; water demand, however, cannot be satisfied by the allowable diversion rate; (2) ecological feasible region is an accessible constraint for reservoir operation model, and the optimal diversion rate of such model is a trade-off output between the human water demand and the riverine ecosystems protection; and (3) increased allowable diversion rates alter flow indicators including the February flow, 30-day minimum flow, and low pulse count more appreciably than does the optimal diversion rate. This study provides key insights on how to achieve a trade-off between human water demand and riverine ecosystems protection, therefore contributing to the local sustainable development of social economy and ecological environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'This paper presents the co-learning process outcomes based on Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) and Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). EbA principles are directly associated with resilience improvement that depends on NbS for change of patterns and actions. Basically, we expected to explore how urban systems can be improved avoiding environmental degradation (i.e. waste ecosystem services and their benefits). Therefore, distinct scenarios were proposed with specific objectives: (1) identification of barriers and challenges; (2) identification of opportunities for NbS implementation. Throughout a workshop, we had chance to discuss knowledge gaps and potential emerging research such as: (1) synergies between DRR and EbA; (2) a long-term perspective of ecosystem management; (3) dynamic of DRR and the natural processes involved considering the complexity of NbS. We conclude that existing measures are limited in their ecological focus regarding to DRR and benefits they address. For this reason, a more comprehensive approach to support NbS and its systematic mainstreaming is required. © 2019',\n",
       " 'Urbanization deletes and degrades natural ecosystems, threatens biodiversity, and alienates people from the experience of nature. Nature-based solutions (NbS) that are inspired and supported by nature have the potential to deliver multifunctional environmental and social benefits to address these challenges in urban areas under context-specific conditions. NbS implementation often relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, although interventions that maximize one benefit (e.g., biodiversity conservation) may have no influence on, or even negatively affect, others (e.g., social justice). Furthermore, the current pathways from NbS to various benefits do not rely on a deep understanding of the underlying processes, prohibiting the identification of optimal solutions that maximize synergies across pathways. We present a comprehensive socio-ecological framework that addresses these issues by recognizing that cities are human-dominated environments that are foremost built and maintained to support humans. Our framework demonstrates how we can use experiments and niche species models to understand and predict where species will be and where people will be healthy and happy in a comparable manner. This knowledge can then be integrated into decision support tools that use optimization algorithms to understand trade-offs, identify synergies, and provide planners with the tools needed to tailor context-specific NbS to yield greener, more resilient cities with happier people and reduced inequality. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Phytoremediation offers a nature based solution (NBS) for contaminated soil remediation; however, its application under a brownfield redevelopment context has not been well studied. Moreover, climate change could impact large numbers of contaminated sites, yet there remains little research on the potential impacts for remediation. This study examined phytoremediation at a brownfield redevelopment in the San Francisco Bay area, where thousands of cleanup sites are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to determine both primary and secondary impacts and the system's resilience to various sea level scenarios and hydroclimatic conditions was investigated. It was found that the phytoremediation project rendered only a small environmental footprint, and was associated with low cost and substantial socioeconomic benefits. For instance, it fitted well with the site redevelopment setting by offering attractive landscape features. Moreover, under a modeled moderate sea level rise scenario, the groundwater hydraulic gradient at the site decreased, which was coupled with greater natural biodegradation and reduced plume migration, and, therefore, lower life cycle impact. There was also minimal increase in the vapor intrusion risk with increased sea level. Overall, phytoremediation at the site was found to be resilient to a moderate sea level rise and other hydroclimatic effects induced by climate change. However, the system performance responded to increasing sea level rise in a non-linear manner. Under a high sea level rise scenario, the system is predicted to perform abruptly worse. © 2019 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'CO2 and CH4 flux measurements over a septic tank soakaway located in a northern maritime climate (Ireland)were conducted for a period of 81 days using a multi-chamber automated soil gas flux chamber system with high spatial and temporal resolution. Overall median CO2 fluxes were 7.28; 6.40 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1 from the soakaway and control soil, respectively. Overall median CH4 fluxes were − 0.28; −0.67 nmol CH4 m−2 s−1 from the soakaway and control soil, respectively. While CO2 fluxes expressed strong diurnal variability driven by soil temperature, CH4 fluxes were less affected by environmental factors and effectively limited to the first few meters from the septic tank. However, localised CH4 degassing events were observed during drying conditions with up to 60-times higher fluxes compared to the overall median. The soakaway was found to be a net emitter of both CO2 and CH4, releasing a total of 7.327 kg CO2 yr−1 and 0.033 kg CO2Eq. yr−1, respectively. The apparent spatio-temporal heterogeneity of observed soil gas fluxes identified in this study emphasises the importance of integrating measurements with both high spatial and temporal resolution from on-site installations as engineered nature-based solutions. © 2019',\n",
       " 'Despite recent developments in process-based modeling of treatment wetlands (TW), the dynamic response of horizontal flow (HF) aerated wetlands to interruptions of aeration has not yet been modeled. In this study, the dynamic response of organic carbon and nitrogen removal to interruptions of aeration in an HF aerated wetland was investigated using a recently-developed numerical process-based model. Model calibration and validation were achieved using previously obtained data from pilot-scale experiments. Setting initial concentrations for anaerobic bacteria to high values (« 35-70 mg L~1) and including ammonia sorption was important to simulate the treatment performance of the experimental wetland in transition phases when aeration was switched off and on again. Even though steady-state air flow rate impacted steady-state soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and oxidized nitrogen (NOx-N) concentration length profiles, it did not substantially affect corresponding effluent concentrations during aeration interruption. When comparing simulated with experimental results, it is most likely that extending the model to include mass transfer through the biofilm will allow to better explain the underlying experiments and to increase simulation accuracy. This study provides insights into the dynamic behavior of HF aerated wetlands and discusses assumptions and limitations of the modeling approach. © 2019 IWA Publishing. All rights reserved.',\n",
       " 'The multi-scale carbon-carbon dioxide (C-CO2) dynamics of subtropical urban forests and other green and grey infrastructure types were explored in an urbanized campus near Shanghai, China. We integrated eddy covariance (EC) C-CO2 flux measurements and the Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon footprint tool to analyze C-CO2 dynamics at the landscape-scale as well as in local-scale urban forest patches during one year. The approach measured the C-CO2 flux from different contributing areas depending on wind directions and atmospheric stability. Although the study landscape was a net carbon source (2.98 Mg C ha-1 yr-1), we found the mean CO2 flux in urban forest patches was -1.32 μmol m-2s-1, indicating that these patches function as a carbon sink with an annual carbon balance of -5.00 Mg C ha-1. These results indicate that urban forest patches and vegetation (i.e., green infrastructure) composition can be designed to maximize the sequestration of CO2. This novel integrated modeling approach can be used to facilitate the study of the multi-scale effects of urban forests and green infrastructure on CO2 and to establish low-carbon emitting planning and planting designs in the subtropics. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Combined natural and engineered water and waste water systems (cNES)are nature-based solutions that utilise naturally occurring processes to remove impurities from water and therefore contribute to the ecosystem service of water quality enhancement. We hypothesise that these systems may also have a potential to deliver ecosystem services other than their primary purpose of water purification and we use spatially-explicit modelling tools to determine these benefits. We focused on three different types of cNES: bank filtration (BF), managed aquifer recharge/soil aquifer treatment (MAR/SAT), and constructed wetlands (CW), and combined the ecosystem services cascade, DESSIN and CICES conceptual frameworks with multiple InVEST 3.4.4 models to investigate the spatial distribution of intermediate ecosystem services within the sites as well as in the surrounding landscape. We also determined the role of habitats present within the sites in wider landscape's connectivity to the nearest Natura 2000 areas using the Circuitscape 4.0 model, assessed the public perception of the aesthetic value of two of the cNES technologies, i.e. CW and MAR/SAT, via an online survey, and linked the determined ecosystem services to their likely beneficiaries. Our results indicated that the sites characterised with semi-natural ecosystems had a good potential for ecosystem services provision and that the selected cNES technologies were favourably received by the public as compared to their engineered equivalents. We concluded that determination of ecosystem services potential from nature-based solutions, such as cNES technologies, should be done in consideration of various contextual factors including the type of habitats/ecosystems present within the proposed solutions, the location within the landscape as well as properties and ecosystem services potential of the areas surrounding the sites, all of which can be facilitated by deployment of spatially-explicit ecosystem service models at early stages of the planning process. © 2019 The Author(s)\",\n",
       " 'Urbanization changes the natural environment, alters land use, and affects the hydrological cycle. Due to decreased infiltration, runoff appears faster with higher flow peaks. A nature-based solution is to plant trees because they intercept precipitation and help to reduce water reaching the ground, forming surface runoff. Rainfall partitioning for birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) trees is measured in the city of Ljubljana, Slovenia, during 2014 and 2015. The measured values for two consecutive years are used to estimate potential surface runoff reduction due to planting of the trees at a parking lot. The results demonstrate that birch and pine trees intercepted 23 and 45% of gross rainfall, respectively. Both tree species intercept more rainfall in the leafed period. Additionally, rainfall interception during wet (2014) and dry (2015) years has been compared. In 2014 rainfall interception is highly influenced by rainfall intensity, while it has a negligible impact on rainfall interception in 2015, when air temperature is more influential. The scenario of covering 10% of the parking lot area with the trees results in runoff reduction of up to 7.3% per year. In general, runoff reduction is higher in a wet rather than a dry year. The new findings about the performance of different tree species in different climate conditions can offer valuable information for the decision makers and landscape designers about the benefits of trees in urban areas. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The methodology's utility is illustrated on urban catchment in the city of Girona, Spain. The SWMM model was applied and calibrated to simulate SCM scenarios. Seven scenarios were evaluated consisting of one grey infrastructure measure using underground storage tank and three nature-based SCM i.e. infiltration basins, infiltration trenches, green roofs, and combinations thereof. These scenarios were evaluated with MCA including combined sewer overflow (CSO)reduction, CAPEX, OPEX, amenity, biodiversity, and feasibility regarding ownership. The results show that the scenario that included only infiltration basins was most favourable, followed by the scenario which combined infiltration basins and trenches. The underground storage tank was the least favourable with the lowest grade, due to high CAPEX and OPEX, and due to single functionality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " \"Rewilding is increasingly recognized as a conservation tool but is often context specific, which inhibits broad application. Rewilding in Australia seeks to enhance ecosystem function and promote self-sustaining ecosystems. An absence of large-bodied native herbivores means trophic rewilding in mainland Australia has focused on the restoration of functions provided by apex predators and small mammals. Because of the pervasive influence of introduced mesopredators, predator-proof fences, and establishment of populations on predator-free islands are common rewilding approaches. This sets Australian rewilding apart from most jurisdictions and provides globally relevant insights but presents challenges to restoring function to broader landscapes. Passive rewilding is of limited utility in arid zones. Although increasing habitat extent and quality in mesic coastal areas may work, it will likely be necessary to undertake active management. Because much of Australia's population is in urban areas, rewilding efforts must include urban areas to maximize effectiveness. Thus rewilding is not synonymous with wilderness and can occur over multiple scales. Rewilding efforts must recognize human effects on other species and benefit both nature and humans. Rewilding in Australia requires development of a shared vision and strategy and proof-of-concept projects to demonstrate the benefits. The repackaging of existing conservation activities as rewilding may confuse and undermine the success of rewilding programs and should be avoided. As elsewhere, rewilding in Australia should be viewed as an important conservation tool. © 2019 Society for Conservation Biology\",\n",
       " 'This study investigates the impact of beach sediment supply on dune volume evolution through data analysis and model simulations of the Kennemer dunes in the Netherlands. A cross-shore sediment transport model (the CS-model) is applied with local time-averaged longshore sediment transport gradients derived from bathymetric and topographic observations. The model is used to study the relative importance of different transport processes on dune volume evolution, assuming that aeolian transport from the beach to the dune is supply-limited. The wave-driven longshore transport gradients are found to explain a large part of the observed variation in the dune evolution within the study area. In accreting parts of the coast, dunes are growing due to sediment supply from longshore transport, whereas in eroding parts, dune growth depends on supply from artificial nourishments. Seasonal constructions on the beach and vegetation removal from the dunes partly impede dune growth along the considered stretch of coast. The model performance is satisfactory, being able to reproduce a considerable part of the large variation in the alongshore dune response observed in the study area. Overall, the results are a promising contribution to the capability of simulating decadal-scale dune evolution, which is important for long-term flood risk assessments and safe designs of nature-based solutions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Australia’s rapid coastal population growth coupled with the increased risk of hazards driven by climate change creates an urgent need to start adaptation planning for the future. The most common solutions for protecting the coast (seawalls, breakwaters) are expensive and non-adaptive (i.e., they need to be rebuilt, upgraded and maintained in response to a changing climate). There is international precedence for the development of nature-based solutions (i.e., the integration of natural habitats such as coastal vegetation and biogenic reefs) as a cost-effective and sustainable approach to shoreline protection from erosion and flooding. The development of nature-based approaches has been supported by large interdisciplinary teams to inform policy and decision-making. Nature-based coastal defence is currently not a tool widely used in Australia. Key to their wider implementation is: (1) improved scientific knowledge; (2) effective governance; and (3) social acceptance. Recently implemented pilot trials need to inform industry-accredited guidelines that can be integrated into coastal management and government policy. © 2019, © 2019 Engineers Australia.',\n",

Crushed autoclaved aerated concrete (CAAC), a by-product from demolition, has shown great potential for recovering P. The potential of CAAC to be used in nature-based solutions as a P-reactive filter medium was evaluated by performing preliminary batch essays. Here, we evaluated the interactions and main effects of the initial concentration of P (Pi; 5, 10 or 20 mg L-1), particle size (PS; 4 or 5 mm) and contact time (CT; 60, 180, 360, 720 and 1440 min) upon the removal. We performed physical and chemical characterization to understand the removal processes. Data collected were fitted in adsorption kinetic models. The statistical analysis showed a significant interaction between CT and Pi, with the combination of its main effects stronger on P removal than each one separately. Intriguingly, we noticed that the higher the concentration of Pi, the faster and higher the removal of P. Contrary to expectations, PS 5mmshowed higher removal rates than PS 4 mm, indicating that besides adsorption, other unidentified chemical processes are in place.

An analysis of the first phase of the project is carried out, using a multi-dimensional model.

       " 'Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to climate change is an approach claimed to deliver social benefits relevant to marginalized groups. Based on a structured literature review, we interrogate such claims, asking whether such approaches may (or may not) contribute to social change and, more specifically, empowerment. We present a review of the predominant meaning and interlinkages of the EbA and empowerment concepts, which shows that EbA pays insufficient attention to issues of empowerment and agency. On this basis, we discuss how an empowerment lens could be (better) integrated into the conceptualization of EbA, suggesting key dimensions through which this could be supported. We show that the emphasis on empowerment theory and the merits that it brings to the EbA literature are helpful, leading to a number of important questions to adaptation projects on the ground. Incorporating an empowerment lens leads to an increased consideration of issues of power more broadly, especially the way marginalized groups’ agency, access, and aspirations are conditioned by social structures that may prevent strategic adaptation choices. We conclude that EbA will facilitate empowerment better by explicitly considering how social benefits can emerge from the interplay between particular types of actions, marginalized people’s adaptive strategies, and their relational context. © 2019 by the author(s).',\n",
       " 'This research evaluates the contribution of nature-based solutions to urban resilience in post-disaster situations. Post-disaster recovery planning is an opportunity to ‘build back greener’ by fostering ecosystem approaches towards social and ecological resilience. Yet understanding of specific post-disaster resilience benefits which nature-based solutions provide is still emerging. This paper contributes to this field through evaluation of how ecosystem approaches bring resilience benefits in Futaba County, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, following the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. Content analysis is undertaken on disaster recovery plans produced by the 8 municipalities in Futaba County. The ecosystem services included in each plan are identified, as well as the extent to which municipalities are capable of assessing the services provided. This is supplemented with insights from field visits and wider documentation produced by the municipalities. The analysis shows that cultural ecosystem services feature especially strongly within the plans, and that these cultural services are critical to recovering sense of identity and pride post-disaster. However, the analysis also indicates that municipalities may lack the technical competence to assess ecosystem services, especially in a post-disaster setting where resources are stretched. One implication from the research is the need for further consideration in other empirical contexts of how cultural services – especially citizen participation – can be integrated with more technical approaches to post-disaster ecosystem management. A second implication is that whilst ecosystem approaches offer post-disaster resilience benefits, these should be an aid to recovery and not a substitute for long-term support from national governments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Recent coastal storms and associated recovery efforts have led to increased investment in nature-based coastal protection, including restoration of salt marshes and construction of living shorelines. In particular, many of these efforts focus on increasing vertical elevation through sediment nourishment, where sediment is removed from the tidal channel and placed on the marsh plain, or preventing lateral erosion through shoreline protection. In the USA alone, millions of dollars have been allocated or spent on these coastal protection solutions over the last few decades because of their perceived sustainability and ecologically positive co-benefits including habitat provision and carbon sequestration. These projects would benefit from integration of sediment transport pathways, budgets, and metrics during planning and modeling of restoration outcomes, in order to evaluate sustainability before investment. This is analogous to the decades of experience with coastal management and engineering on the open coast. Salt marshes are geomorphic features that rely partially on external sediment supply to maintain their network of tidal channels, intertidal flats, and marsh plain. Removing sediment from one component of the overall system to nourish another component may be counterproductive, given that the net sediment budget is unchanged. For example, dredging a tidal channel beyond its equilibrium condition will cause it to fill with sediment from the tidal flat or elsewhere in the system. This may cause slumping of the marsh edge, or over-deepening of other sections of the channel to compensate. Similarly, shoreline protection that prevents edge erosion hampers the marsh plain’s ability to accrete on the levee and naturally transgress landward or it starves other components of the system of regularly supplied sediment. A limited vertical or lateral-only perspective, instead of a three-dimensional perspective, during project planning and evaluation may lead to suboptimal decision-making regarding restoration priorities, approaches, and outcomes. I contend that before significant investments are made in marsh restoration through sediment nourishment or shoreline protection, sediment transport measurements and models that consider sediment dynamics should be integrated into the early phases of restoration planning. This will help identify where and under what conditions marsh restoration will most likely be successful and economically justified. Triaging and prioritizing is then possible, which is a sustainable approach for restoration, given the persistent vulnerability of marshes to sea-level rise, storms, and sediment deficits. © 2019, The Author(s).',\n",
       " \"Brazil's environmental legislation obliges private properties to retain a fixed proportion of their total area with native vegetation, the so-called “Legal Reserves”. Those areas represent practically one third of the country's native vegetation and are well known for their role in biodiversity protection and in the provisioning of a wide range of ecosystem services for landowners and society. Despite their relevance, this instrument has been criticized by part of the agribusiness sector and its representatives in the Brazilian Congress. The Legal Reserve requirement is said to be too restrictive and to impede the full expansion of agricultural activities, and thus to be detrimental for the development of the country. Here, we critically analyze the arguments employed in the justification of a recently proposed bill that aims to completely extinguish Legal Reserves. We demonstrate that the arguments used are mostly unsupported by data, evidence or theory, besides being based on illogical reasoning. Further, we synthesize the principal benefits of Legal Reserves, including health and economic benefits, and emphasize the importance of these reserves for water, energy, food, and climate securities, in addition to their primary function of assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We also highlight that Legal Reserves are a key-component for effective and less expensive nature-based solutions, and thus should be considered as assets for the development of Brazil rather than liabilities. Based on available sound scientific evidence and agreement on their relevance, we strongly oppose any attempt to extinguish or weaken the maintenance of Brazil's Legal Reserves. © 2019\",\n",
       " 'Rural roads are important for the communities in the hilly areas of Nepal as they introduce livelihood opportunities at the local level, and provide better access to the healthcare, education, and resources. Yet, most of the rural roads in Nepal are unplanned and non-engineered, and these roads are often closed for many months during and after the monsoon. Such roads require huge investments, especially post-monsoon, to clear debris and to keep them operational. In parallel, there is evidence that such roads lead to a large number of slope failures and accelerated sedimentation, which degrade the environment and ecosystem services. To remedy such roadside slope failures, eco-engineering practices were tested and demonstrated in partnership with three communities in the Panchase Region of the Nepal’s Central–Western hills. Eco-engineering is a hybrid approach, combining civil engineering works for drainage and slope stability, with the plantation of deep-rooted vegetation. It is one activity contributing to nature-based solutions (NbS) for the sustainable and long-term operation of the rural roads in the Panchase geographic region. This paper describes the inter-disciplinary and community-based research, monitoring, and evaluation methods applied, including the establishment of onsite demonstration plots and rhizotrons in which key performance indicator (KPI) analysis of plant species was performed. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of eco-engineering for reducing risk, while creating ecological co-benefits along rural roads (or eco-safe roads) in hilly areas. Based on this research, an “eco-safe rural road assessment framework” was developed, outlining the systematic process to be followed for the design of eco-safe rural roads for more sustainable road construction and maintenance. The eco-engineering practices which are being promoted by this framework were accepted by communities and could be further implemented by local government bodies and upscaled in other similar hilly areas around the country. © 2019 by the authors.

       " \"Cities often don't appreciate the benefits of green infrastructure (GI) enough. To recognise the extent to which green infrastructure and nature-based solutions (NbS) are present in the urban policy, we conducted a review of planning, strategic and programming documents of Poznań City as a Case Study. The study is aimed at 1) diagnosing of current position NbS in the tasks and directions of planning, strategic and programming documents; 2) characteristic of activities related to NbS according to the form of human-nature interaction; 3) determining the potential of including NbS in the local policy; 4) identifying the role of NbS in facing 4 main challenges in urban policy: resilience and climate change adaptation, health and well-being, social cohesion, economic development potential. The results show that a significant number of actions focus on GI changes towards its multifunctionality and better quality, while there are not many actions towards supporting citizens in using it. Also, despite urban pressure, new green spaces are still planned to be created. The role of NbS within GI in urban resilience is well recognised. Yet, the adaptation to climate change has gained a low priority so far. Linkages between GI and the wellbeing of inhabitants are well understood. However, the possibility to build and strengthen social cohesion based on GI is rather marginally noticed. The least recognised is the influence of NbS on the economic development potential. It is an area that still needs to be investigated to bring evidence in this field. We conclude that to support large-scale, nature-based solution implementation in cities, the crucial step is to bring them into the local urban agenda. An evaluation of urban policy documents based on the presented approach can serve as a guideline for identifying gaps and potentials for NbS inclusion. As a result, it can help the better organisation of urban policy and harmonisation of different sectors through NbS. © 2019 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Agricultural sectors are facing various environmental threats, such as land degradation and water resource depletion. Agricultural water use and cropping patterns are closely linked to each other, with both related to the regional climate. This study evaluated the impacts of future climate and agricultural land-use changes on agricultural water consumption in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID), China. The results show that owing to an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation, the future climate in the research area will become warmer and dryer, which will increase the water demand of crops. Future climate in the HID will lead to a 10.5% increase in total irrigation water demand under a scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions and a 6.9% increase under a scenario of low greenhouse gas emissions. Results of the grey prediction modeling indicate that the amount of water allocated to the agricultural sector will decrease, which will make it difficult to meet crop irrigation demands. The results of the gray model also show that the cropping pattern in the HID will vary over time, and the proportion of the area of cash crops will increase by 5.3% during the next decade. Regional agricultural water use can be reduced by adjusting the cropping pattern under irrigation water limitations. Meanwhile, the saved water can be used for soil desalination in cultivated land in the HID. Consequently, adjusting the cropping pattern is a nature-based solution by which to address climate change and guarantee the sustainable use of regional water and land resources. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",
       " 'Excessive phosphorus (P) export to aquatic ecosystems can lead to impaired water quality. There is a growing interest among watershed managers in using restored wetlands to retain P from agricultural landscapes and improve water quality. We develop a novel framework for prioritizing wetland restoration at a regional scale. The framework uses an ecosystem service model and an optimization algorithm that maximizes P reduction for given levels of restoration cost. Applying our framework in the Lake Champlain Basin, we find that wetland restoration can reduce P export by 2.6% for a budget of $50 M and 5.1% for a budget of $200 M. Sensitivity analysis shows that using finer spatial resolution data for P sources results in twice the P reduction benefits at a similar cost by capturing hot-spots on the landscape. We identify 890 wetlands that occur in more than 75% of all optimal scenarios and represent priorities for restoration. Most of these wetlands are smaller than 7 ha with contributing area less than 100 ha and are located within 200 m of streams. Our approach provides a simple yet robust tool for targeting restoration efforts at regional scales and is readily adaptable to other restoration strategies. © 2019 The Author(s).

The urban heat island effect, combined with warming effects of climate change, is likely to cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events. Alterations to the physical, built environment are a viable option for mitigating urban heat, yet few studies provide systematic guidance to practitioners for adapting diverse land uses. In this study, we examine the use of green infrastructure treatments to evaluate changes in ambient temperatures across diverse land uses in the city of Portland, Oregon. We apply ENVI-met® microclimate modeling at the city-block scale specifically to determine what built environment characteristics are most associated with high temperatures, and the extent to which different physical designs reduce ambient temperature. The analysis included six green infrastructure interventions modeled across six different land-use types, and indicated the varying degrees to which approaches are effective. Results were inconsistent across landscapes, and showed that one mitigation solution alone would not significantly reduce extreme heat. These results can be used to develop targeted, climate- and landscape-specific cooling interventions for different land uses, which can help to inform and refine current guidance to achieve urban climate adaptation goals. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",

However, research has mainly focused on large lakes, while urban reservoirs and their catchments, especially in tropical regions, are still poorly studied despite the wide range of ecosystem services they provide. An integrated modelling approach coupling the hydrological model Storm Water Management Model SWMM and the lake ecological model DYRESM-CAEDYM is proposed for Lake Pampulha (Brazil). Scenarios of increased imperviousness of the catchment and of reduction in the load of nutrients and total suspended solids (TSS) in dry weather inflow were simulated. Runoff water quality simulations presented a fair performance for TSS and ammonium (NH4 +) while the dynamics of total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate (NO3 -) were poorly captured. Phytoplankton dynamics in the lake were simulated with good accuracy (Normalized Mean Absolute Error, NMAE = 0.24 and r = 0.89 in calibration period; NMAE = 0.55 and r = 0.54 in validation period). The general trends of growth, decline and the magnitude of phytoplankton biomass were well represented most of the time. Scenario simulations suggest that TP reduction will decrease cyanobacteria biomass and delay its peaks as a consequence of orthophosphate (PO4 3-) concentration reduction in the lake surface layers. However, even decreasing TP load into Lake Pampulha by half would not be sufficient to achieve the water quality objective of a maximum concentration of 60 μg chla L-1. Increased imperviousness in the catchment will raise runoff volume, TSS, TP and NO3 - loads into Lake Pampulha and promote greater cyanobacteria biomass, mainly in the beginning of the wet season, because of additional nutrient input from catchment runoff. Recovering Lake Pampulha water quality will require the improvement of the sanitation system. The lake water quality improvement will also require more sustainable and nature-based solutions for urban drainage in order to reduce non-point pollution through infiltration and retention of stormwater and to enhance natural processes, such as chemical sorption, biodegradation and phytoremediation. The integrated modelling approach here proposed can be applied for other urban reservoirs taking advantage of existing knowledge on Lake Pampulha. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'During the last two decades, a mounting body of research has emerged on the value, use and overall importance of urban green infrastructure. From the contribution to human well-being and sustainable development, urban green infrastructure is positioned as a relevant concept within ecosystem services and nature-based solutions. Our research objective is to identify the main scientific approaches to urban green infrastructure, while accounting for different comparative criteria, such as subject of analysis, methods used, location or scale. We used an analysis of scientific literature in order to identify trends on urban green infrastructure research. We designed a study consisting of peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings, published between 2005 and 2017 and listed in Science Direct database. We identified 497 peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings, of which we validated 490 papers that included keywords. We used network analysis to identify significant patterns on the keywords co-occurrence in the scientific literature. Our main results identified the most used, powerful and influential keywords, while comparing the European network with the rest of the world. We found that terms such as: green infrastructure, ecosystem services and urban forestry are among the most used keywords in the ongoing body of literature. Our study tries to better understand the directions used so far to analyse urban green infrastructure and the differences that occur between areas or scale of analysis. Main findings suggested by our results could anticipate shortcomings or future research, while better establishing the importance of urban green infrastructure as a nature-based solution. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'Green walls, installed on the side of the buildings, mainly for their aesthetics and micro climate benefits, could become effective on-site greywater treatment solutions. However, far more research is needed to convert these nature-based systems into low-cost water purification technologies. This process study presents the first step in development of greywater-treating green walls by examining how variation in plant spaces and operational conditions (hydraulic loading rate, inflow concentrations and intermittent drying) influence nutrient removal from light greywater. The experiment was conducted over 12 months on a large-scale pilot green wall located in a laboratory in Melbourne, Australia. The results showed that ornamental plant species can successfully adapt to greywater only irrigation regime and play an important role in nitrogen and phosphorus uptake from greywater. Higher performing plants, C. appressa, N. obliterate, M. parvifolium and L. muscari, had on average 7–10% higher TN removal than unvegetated configuration (over 88% removal overall), which is attributed to consistently high NO x uptake. On the other hand, poorer performing plants O. japonicus, P. occidentalis and N. officinale tended to leach NO x , likely due to their shallow or slow developing root systems. While low retention times hindered high TP removal from all tested configurations, high dependency on plant species and operational conditions was still observed, with C. appressa and N. obliterata being the two highest performing plants (34–53% removal during standard operation). The overall phosphorus uptake was found to improve over time, suggesting that plant growth is a significant TP removal mechanism in green walls. While drying caused a performance drop for all designs, higher performing plant species were less affected by changes in operational conditions. The tested configurations showed good resilience to sudden inflow concentration increases, suggesting green walls could be used as a robust and aesthetically attractive on-site greywater treatment system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"Rapid urbanization presents one of the most urgent challenges of our times. Cities must cope with poor air quality, heat island effects, increased flood risk and the frequency/severity of extreme events (e.g., droughts and heat waves), increasing crime and social inequity, poverty and degraded urban environments, amongst other negative consequences. Climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as sustainable management are therefore key challenges for cities in Europe and around the world. What must be developed therefore is a robust, wide evidence-base and reference framework of nature-based solutions (NBS) – measures that mimic the complex features and processes of natural ecosystems – for local/regional city authorities and other policy and decision makers to increase climate resilience and address inclusive urban regeneration in cities. In response to this need, we propose an applicative framework for NBS using the structure of the DPSIR (Driving force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response) model, in conformity with European Community standards. Indeed, under the umbrella of the EC's Framework Program – Horizon 2020 – international institutions, scientific experts and policy makers worldwide are seeking to increase collaboration with cities to enhance ecosystem services and develop the evidence-base for the economic, social and environmental benefits of nature-based solutions. They are eager to exchange knowledge and inspire positive action for nature in urban areas to meet their growing social and environmental challenges. The time has come to acknowledge NBS as the most fitting response to the numerous challenges posed by our changing climate and for the realization of sustainable and healthy cities. It is hoped that this article will pioneer others in settling the issue for NBS as the undisputable answer to challenged urban landscapes and societies globally. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.\",\n",
       " 'The growing recognition of the contribution of urban areas to adaptation and mitigation strategies implemented in response to climate change has led to several policy initiatives. Among others, the “Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy” is the most acknowledged, providing local governments with the opportunity to overcome the mitigation-adaptation dichotomy and enhance urban resilience. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the synergy between adaptation and mitigation actions in some European Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans at an urban level. We will do this through: (1) the proposal of a novel classification model of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, which will be capable of classifying, in a common way, the best practices carried out at an urban level; and (2) a comparison of the best climate change management practices carried out by two European countries (Italy and Spain). The classification model is based on three urban sectors: (1) Urban Adaptation and Health (UA&H), (2) Transport & Infrastructure (T&I), and (3) Energy (NRG). Urban management measures have been classified as soft (more focused on environmental information), gray (more focused on buildings), and green (more focused on nature-based solutions). The overall comparative analysis between Italy and Spain shows that in large and medium-sized Italian cities, mainly soft (52%) and green (28%) adaptation measures have been integrated into local energy-environmental planning in combination with mitigation actions. However, in both countries, decisions regarding the type of measures to be implemented are taken independently of the size of the city. This paper, in line with other research, highlights the importance of nature-based solutions as a first step in the integration process between adaptation and mitigation strategies at an urban level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'This paper presents a pilot study meant to reduce phosphorous (P) inflow into the Sulejów Reservoir (Poland) by constructing a riparian plant buffer zone enhanced with a limestone-based barrier along the reservoir shoreline. The location was characterized by high P contamination of shallow groundwater (with influent P-PO 4 concentration ranging between 0.62 and 4.1 mg P/L and DP varying between 0.68 and 9.42 mg P/L). Firstly, we constructed a limestone-based barrier across the mount of a periodically flowing stream and tested its effectiveness at P removal over a period of 3.5 years. P-PO 4 and DP removal effectiveness rates were found to be variable, increasing with influent concentration, but overall long-term average effectiveness was similar for P-PO 4 and DP removal, at 12.4% and 13.0%, respectively. Secondly, we also planted six selected plant species along the shoreline and observed their natural ecological succession over the same period. Higher P uptake was observed for Schoenoplectus lacustris and Glyceria maxima one year after planting, whereas Phragmites australis needed three years to root. Furthermore, the species composition of the plant community increased from 17 to 34 species. Overall, the study provides an example of how the phosphorus recovery-and-reuse approach should be considered in improving measures for the reduction of diffuse pollution from rural areas, especially in terms of the development of nature-based solutions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Many contaminated brownfield sites are being left abandoned due to the high cost of remediation. Traditional physical and chemical remediation technologies also require high energy and resource input, and can result in loss of land functionality and cause secondary pollution. Nature-based solutions (NBS) including phytoremediation and conversion of brownfield sites to public greenspaces, holds much promise in maximizing a sustainable urban renaissance. NBS is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature based, cost effective and eco-friendly treatment technologies, as well as redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. The NBS concept is novel and in urgent need of new research to better understand the pros and cons, and to enhance its practicality.

A total of 303 responses and 301 responses for customer and employee groups, respectively, were used for data analysis. Our results of the structural analysis indicated that green indoor and outdoor environment as NBS helps customers and employees improve mental health perception, emotional well-being, and loyalty. In addition, the prominent role of emotional well-being in building customer loyalty and of mental health perception in building employee loyalty was uncovered. The developed conceptual frameworks for customers and employees contained a satisfactory ability in predicting loyalty. Mental health perception and emotional well-being were mediators.

       " 'Due to the reduction in the prices of oranges on the market and social changes such as the ageing of the population, traditional orange plantation abandonment in the Mediterranean is taking place. Previous research on land abandonment impact on soil and water resources has focused on rainfed agriculture abandonment, but there is no research on irrigated land abandonment. In the Valencia Region-the largest producer of oranges in Europe-abandonment is resulting in a quick vegetation recovery and changes in soil properties, and then in water erosion. Therefore, we performed rainfall simulation experiments (0.28 m2; 38.8 mm h-1) to determine the soil losses in naveline orange plantations with different ages of abandonment (1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years of abandonment) which will allow for an understanding of the temporal changes in soil and water losses after abandonment. Moreover, these results were also compared with an active plantation (0). The results show that the soils of the active orange plantations have higher runoffdischarges and higher erosion rates due to the use of herbicides than the plots after abandonment. Once the soil is abandoned for one year, the plant recovery reaches 33% of the cover and the erosion rate drops one order of magnitude. This is related to the delay in the runoffgeneration and the increase in infiltration rates. After 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years, the soil reduced bulk density, increase in organic matter, plant cover, and soil erosion rates were found negligible. We conclude that the abandonment of orange plantations reduces soil and water losses and can serve as a nature-based solution to restore the soil services, goods, and resources. The reduction in the soil losses was exponential (from 607.4 g m-2 in the active plot to 7.1 g m-2 in the 10-year abandoned one) but the water losses were linear (from 77.2 in active plantations till 12.8% in the 10-year abandoned ones). © 2019 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Land degradation affects natural and cultivated socio-ecosystems worldwide. Soil erosion is one of the main processes leading to land degradation, and the process is accelerated by human actions. Spain is dealing with extensive land degradation caused by land use and land cover change (LULCC), for instance by land abandonment, and local geo-ecological conditions. Recent land abandonment in Spain can be largely related to changing policies and international market development, which have resulted in the reallocation of agriculture and a shift from traditional rainfed crops to intensification of irrigated agriculture. This radical change in LULCC by land abandonment resulted in two opposite trends, towards greening-up and towards land degradation, each with enormous consequences for the environment by its effects on soil hydrology, runoff, sediment sources, soil erosion, fluvial channel adjustments and forest fire risks. To mitigate negative effects, appropriate management and conservation strategies are necessary. In this review, we analyze the top-down policy framework of soil conservation in Spain, with a specific focus on the Region of Murcia. We found that multiple international policies, i.e. the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the European Water Framework Directive and the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), contribute to soil and water conservation at the national level, where the national administration selects most appropriate measures according to the country's current state. These measures are incorporated in national policies, such as the National Action Plan to Combat Desertification and the National Rural Development Programme. In case of the CAP, agro-environmental subsidies are an instrument to promote soil protection at a national level. Regionally adjusted sub-measures, based on regional environmental characteristics, are then integrated in the Regional Rural Development Programmes of the Spanish Autonomous Communities. The application of subsidies, related to soil protection, is found to be controversial, as studies do not agree upon its effect on soil erosion and land degradation control. To improve decision-making, concepts such as the ecosystem service approach and nature-based solutions are suggested to be included in future policies, as these concepts aim to improve the status of the entire ecosystem in a more holistic manner than is currently the case. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Flood risks are increasing worldwide due to climate change and ongoing economic and demographic development in coastal areas. Salt marshes can function as vegetated foreshores that reduce wave loads on coastal structures such as dikes and dams, thereby mitigating current and future flood risk. This paper aims to quantify long-term (100 years) flood risk reduction by salt marshes. Dike-foreshore configurations are assessed by coupled calculations of wave energy dissipation over the foreshore, sediment accretion under sea level rise, the probability of dike failure, and life-cycle costs. Rising sea levels lead to higher storm waves, and increasing probabilities of dike failure by wave overtopping. This study shows that marsh elevation change due to sediment accretion mitigates the increase in wave height, thereby elongating the lifetime of a dike-foreshore system. Further, different human interventions on foreshores are assessed in this paper: realization of a vegetated foreshore via nourishment, addition of a detached earthen breakwater, addition of an unnaturally high zone, or foreshore build-up by application of brushwood dams that enhance sediment accretion. The performance of these strategies is compared to dike heightening for the physical boundary conditions at an exposed dike along the Dutch Wadden Sea. Cost-effectiveness depends on three main factors. First, wave energy dissipation, which is lower for salt marshes with a natural elevation in the intertidal zone, when compared to foreshores with a high zone or detached breakwater. Second, required costs for construction and maintenance. Continuous maintenance costs and delayed effects on flood risk make sheltering structures less attractive from a flood risk perspective. Third, economic value of the protected area, where foreshores are particularly cost-effective for low economic value. Concluding, life-cycle cost analysis demonstrates that, within certain limits, foreshore construction can be more cost-effective than dike heightening. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Farm ponds, which are sometimes numerous and widely distributed in agricultural regions, have faced widespread degradation in recent decades. Although conservation strategies for these biodiversity hotspots have gradually increased, appropriate approaches for developing country contexts are lacking. Farm ponds provided hydrologic, biogeochemical, and socioeconomic benefits to southern China for thousands of years, but they are facing contemporary threats and management challenges, including (1) inadequate planning in terms of construction and conservation regulations; (2) rural nonpoint source and mini-point source pollution; (3) climate change induced abnormalities in the hydroperiod and disturbance to wildlife; (4) invasive species; and (5) inadequate social and political capacity to consider ecological conservation. Because farm ponds function as wetland complexes that are embedded within or integral to larger ecosystems, their conservation requires collaborative efforts over scales ranging from within-pond to regional. We highlight approaches that build public awareness and involve inventory maps as a basis. Policies that integrate top-down regulation and bottom-up engagement and emphasize sustainable management and utilization are recommended to ensure the effectiveness and continuous improvement of conservation programs. Techniques that involve interconnected smart sensors, volunteering and citizen science, and integrated process-based modeling are preferred when conducting comprehensive descriptions of the pond landscape, numerical assessments on their ecosystem services, and associated conservation cost analyses. Nature-based solutions are increasingly recognized as an important opportunity for coping with water-related crises. This paper presents the first synthetic perspective on the ecological roles of farm ponds in agriculturally dominated developing countries.

       " 'Growing and densifying cities set challenges for preserving and enhancing sufficient and good quality green urban environment. Rooftops offer vacant room for additional urban greening that may contribute to the well-being of people and the liveability of cities, but this potential lacks empirical support. In spite of the fact that even small green spaces produce, for example restorative experiences, the literature concerning the experiential and recreational benefits of green roofs is still scarce. To identify the experiential potential of a small urban green roof we explored restorative and other experiences of 178 people visiting a sparsely vegetated green roof in the centre of Helsinki, Finland, using a questionnaire. We showed that the studied green roof provided restorative and other positive experiences to the visitors. The level of perceived restorativeness was relatively high. In addition, the results revealed multiple perceived qualities that reflected visual as well as other sensory experiences, beauty, suitability of the place for oneself and the urban context, nature, desire to explore the place and interestedness, positive excitement, and safety. Furthermore, answers to the open questions revealed a wide range of other observations and feelings, such as peace, joy, excitement and hope. Our study indicates that even a small and rather ascetic accessible green roof has potential to offer a moment of respite in the middle of urban everyday hassle, thus implying that these kinds of solutions may allow for a pinch of beneficial green in places where more diverse and lusher solutions are not possible due to, e.g. the load capacity of a roof. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'Much has been written about the potential contribution of citizen-science approaches to further urban environmental sustainability, and associated interventions such as nature-based solutions (NBS). Engagements between researchers and stakeholders relying on bottom-up information provision, for instance community mapping, are often purported to play a vital role in developing shared knowledge, achieving greater impact and stimulating innovation. However, relatively few studies within the realm of NBS have reported on experiences in using volunteered information, or their results. This reflects an important gap, not least because of the proliferation of proposals and bids that rely upon or integrate such methods into their approach. We report on experiences with gathering information using a ‘bottom-up’ map-based wiki tool, which effectively sought to crowd-source data, contributed by members of the public and professional stakeholders. As we approach the milestone of ‘10 years on’ from the inception of the website www.daylighting.org.uk, we reflect on our approach, the opportunities presented, constraints encountered, progress made and results delivered. This is contrasted with other resources and data-gathering projects having similar aims for different urban NBS. Findings are presented on the substantive issue of the uptake of deculverting as a particular form of NBS, including land-use contexts, scheme costs and achievement of stated objectives.

       " 'Raising interest in ‘nature-based solutions’ (NBS) has inspired attempts to organise their principles and qualities within comprehensive and internally consistent evaluation frameworks, so as to demonstrate the superior performance of ‘working with nature’. However, the proposed frameworks stop short of taking into account the changing conditions in which NBS are set to operate. Climate change, in particular, can alter ecosystems and their services, and may undermine the performance of green solutions that rely on them. We present here a ‘dynamic’ assessment framework that explicitly accounts for the impact of climate change on the effectiveness of the proposed NBS. The framework is based on an innovative approach that integrates system analysis and backcasting. Although it has not yet been applied to the NBS context, backcasting is well-suited to seize the transformational character of NBS, as it encourages ‘breakthrough’ leaps rather than incremental improvements. Our framework factors in the multifunctional character of NBS and is designed to capture associated direct benefits/costs and co-benefits/costs. It is meant to be applied ex ante to ideally support the choice between innovative NBS and traditional options, in an effort to respond to the societal challenges identified by the EU Research & Innovation agenda on the environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"Evidences from flood risk management demonstrated that a deep understanding of the main physical phenomena to be addressed is often not enough but should be also integrated with stakeholders' knowledge and risk perception. Particularly, the effectiveness of flood risk management strategies is highly dependent on stakeholders' perception and attitudes, which play a critical role on how individuals and institutions act to mitigate risks. Furthermore, practitioners and policy-makers realized that grey infrastructures may not be the most suitable solution to reduce flood risk, and that a shift from grey solutions to Nature Based Solutions is required. Within this framework, the present work describes a methodology to enhance the Nature Based Solutions implementation by facilitating the generation, acquisition and diffusion of different stakeholders' risk perceptions. It is based on the combination of Problem Structuring Methods for the elicitation of stakeholders' risk perceptions through individual Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, and Ambiguity Analysis for the investigation of differences in risk perceptions and problem framing. The outputs of the Ambiguity Analysis, used during a participatory workshop, facilitated a dialogue aligning the divergences and promoting the social acceptance of Nature Based Solutions.

With significant loss of wetland areas due to expansion of forest, agriculture, and energy production industries, some countries, including Sweden, have begun providing economic support for environmental objectives for wetland conservation and restoration. Targeting such objectives and setting up relevant plans can decrease the risk of losing valuable wetland-related benefits and help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Different ranges of wetland ecosystem services are broadly addressed by the SDGs, however, target-based assessments are required to better understand wetland functionality for sustainable development. This study investigates whether and how wetland ecosystems at local and regional scales can contribute to achieving the SDGs and their targets in Sweden. Scientific literature, policy documents, and international reports on Swedish wetland ecosystems are scrutinized to exemplify the SDGs and their targets, applying a scoring framework based on their interactions. This reveals that, overall, Swedish wetland ecosystems and implemented management plans can positively interact with 10 SDGs and 17 targets at different levels.

Sustainable lake restoration involves limited external interference strong enough to initiate and maintain positive changes in the ecosystem. It was introduced in Lake Durowskie, an urban, flow-through lake situated in Western Poland, using hypolimnetic aeration, phosphorus precipitation with small doses of chemicals and biomanipulation in 2009, and is continued until today. Oxygen conditions in the lake hypolimnion after initial deterioration were gradually improved, and finally a shortening of the duration and range of oxygen deficits was observed. Nitrogen transformations were induced in the hypolimnion by water aeration as well, reducing ammonium N (30% during 2013-2017 in comparison to 2008) and increasing nitrates (90% in 2013-2017 in comparison to 2008). Phosphorus content was diminished (19% during 2015-2017 in relation to 2008 for SRP) due to effective iron-binding and a smaller amount of fresh organic matter being decomposed. Its reduction was related to lower phytoplankton biomass, expressed in a decrease of chlorophyll-a concentrations (55% reduction during 2013-2017 in comparison to 2008) and an increase in water transparency (two-fold during 2013-2017 in relation to 2008) throughout the nine years of treatment.

To this end, the RGI suitability map is overlaid with the planning schemes of the municipal masterplans (MMPs) of three towns belonging to the Metropolitan City of Cagliari (Italy), and multiple linear regressions are performed. The outcomes of the study imply that the eligibility of a land parcel to be part of the RGI depends on several factors related to planning policies entailed by the zoning schemes of the MMPs, such as presence and spreading of conservation and safeguard areas within urban fabrics, improved accessibility of historic and natural landmarks, planned use of nature-based solutions within the regulating codes of MMPs, improvement of habitat quality in the spatial context of rural areas.

       " \"Nature-based solutions are proliferating in European cities over the past years as viable solutions to urban challenges such as climate change, urban degeneration and aging infrastructures. With evidence amounting about nature-based solutions, there is a need to translate knowledge about nature-based solutions to future policy and planning. In this paper, we analysed fifteen cases of nature-based solutions’ experiments across 11 European cities. What makes our case studies stand out is the balanced focus between ecosystem and social benefits in contrast to many published cases on nature-based solutions that have a weighted focus on the climate benefits. From a cross-case comparative analysis we draw seven overarching lessons related to all stages of proof-of-concept and implementation of nature-based solutions in cities: (a) nature-based solutions need to be aesthetically appealing to citizens, (b) nature-based solutions create new green urban commons, (c) experimenting with nature-based solutions requires trust in the local government and in experimentation process itself, (d) co-creation of nature-based solutions requires diversity and learning from social innovation, (e) nature-based solutions require collaborative governance, (f) an inclusive narrative of mission for nature-based solutions can enable integration to many urban agendas and (g) design nature-based solutions so as to learn and replicate them on the long-term. The lessons we draw show that nature-based solutions require multiple disciplines for their design, diversity (of settings) for co-creation and recognition of the place-based transformative potential of nature-based solutions as 'superior’ to grey infrastructure. We further discern that urban planners need to have an open approach to collaborative governance of nature-based solutions that allows learning with and about new appealing designs, perceptions and images of nature from different urban actors, allows forming of new institutions for operating and maintaining nature-based solutions to ensure inclusivity, livability and resilience. © 2018\",\n",
       " 'Urban green infrastructure (UGI) and nature-based solutions are increasingly recognized as instruments to address urban sustainability challenges, yet rely on a good understanding of complex social-ecological system (SES) to function adequately. Adaptive co-management (ACM), engaging a broad variety of stakeholders in collaborative learning, is an effective strategy to improve the resilience of a SES. However, ACM studies have been criticized for neglecting the urban context, while also offering little clarity on process objectives and outcomes. To address these knowledge gaps, while also drawing attention to the important issue of socially inclusive UGI development, we present a guiding framework and approach to encourage the ACM of UGI featuring two main components. Firstly, a Learning Alliance (LA) serves as an instrument for collaborative learning and experimentation across different scales. To facilitate upscaling, we propose to establish a complementary Urban Learning Lab (ULL) to facilitate a regular exchange between the LA and legitimate peripheral networks and stakeholders in the city region. Secondly, a stepwise approach to SES analysis serves to engage a representative group of stakeholders in the LAs and ULLs, and support the processes of setting LA objectives and monitoring of adaptive capacity. We illustrate our approach to the ACM of UGI with a case study of LivadaLAB in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Applying the framework and approach, we demonstrate increased adaptive capacity of the SES around UGI as indicated by: 1) improved overall stakeholder salience, in particular for previously disempowered actor groups, 2) increased number and strength of connections between stakeholders, and 3) the consideration of a broader range of sustainable development objectives by stakeholders in their daily practice. © 2018',\n",

Comparing emissions with the average uptake capacity at each site indicates that currently most sites in the Southeastern part of the U.S. Have enough vegetation cover to offset most emissions while industrial facilities, particularly those in the Western part of the country can benefit the most from restoration. A relatively large fraction of sites in the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, transportation and warehousing, and management of companies and enterprises sectors have enough current or restored capacity to mitigate their emissions. Land around facilities in the finance and insurance, real estate, and retail and leasing sectors lacks much capacity. Such results encourage further work toward sustainable engineering by seeking synergies between industrial and ecological systems. © Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.',\n",
       " \"Spatio-temporal data are more ubiquitous and richer than even before and the availability of such data poses great challenges in data analytics. Ecological facilitation, the positive effect of density of individuals on the individual's survival across a stress gradient, is a complex phenomenon. A large number of tree individuals coupled with soil moisture, temperature, and water stress data across a long temporal period were followed. Data-driven analysis in the absence of hypothesis was performed. Information theoretic analysis of multiple statistical models was employed in order to quantify the best data-driven index of vegetation density and spatial scale of interactions. Sequentially, tree survival was quantified as a function of the size of the individual, vegetation density, and time at the optimal spatial interaction scale. Land surface temperature and soil moisture were also statistically explained by tree size, density, and time. Results indicated that in space both facilitation and competition co-exist in the same ecosystem and the sign and magnitude of this depend on the spatial scale. Overall, within the optimal data-driven spatial scale, tree survival was best explained by the interaction between density and year, sifting overall from facilitation to competition through time. However, small sized trees were always facilitated by increased densities, while large sized trees had either negative or no density effects. Tree size was more important predictor than density in survival and this has implications for nature-based solutions: maintaining large tree individuals or planting species that can become large-sized can safeguard against tree-less areas by promoting survival at long time periods through harsh environmental conditions. Large trees had also a significant effect in moderating land surface temperature and this effect was higher than the one of vegetation density on temperature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",

The Edible City approach promises a strategic step towards the development of sustainable, livable, and healthy cities. We introduce the conceptional framework of Edible City Solutions (ECS), including different forms of urban farming combined with closed loop systems for sustainable water, nutrient, and waste management. We review scientific evidence on ECS benefits for urban regeneration and describe the status quo of ECS in Rotterdam, Andernach, Oslo, Heidelberg, and Havana as case studies. We provide an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to explore the capacity of ECS to enhance multifunctionality of urban landscapes with special focus on social cohesion and quality of life. Based on this we identify and discuss strategies for fostering socially relevant implementations for the case study cities and beyond. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Reusing by-products is an important strategy to ensure the preservation of natural capital and climate change mitigation. This study aimed at evaluating the potential of cork granulates, a by-product of winery industry, as an organic carbon (OC) source for the treatment of hydroponic wastewaters. First, chemical characterization was performed and discussed. Secondly, batch studies were performed using synthetic hydroponic wastewater to understand the role of particle size (PS), pH and contact time (CT) on the release of OC. The suberin is the major compound, representing >50%. It was noticed that a variance on the content of suberin across species, within the same species and depending on the extraction part (belly, cork and back) could be expected. >60% of the sample is composed by carbon while <1% was nitrogen (high C:N ratio), indicating a low risk of releasing organic nitrogen. The statistical results suggested that the main effect of PS on the release of OC is greater than both, CT and pH. The chemical release of OC gets slower with time, being this effect greater as the PS increase. Moreover, estimations showed that using the 4 mm PS, the amount of water treated would be twice the amount if the 8 mm PS had been used. The PS seems to play an important role at design nature-based solutions (NBS) focused on denitrification. The surface response methodology indicates a significant negative interaction between CT and PS suggesting that the mathematical model could be used for further optimization studies. The reuse of organic by-products as filter media seems to be an economic and environmentally friendly alternative to enhance denitrification in NBS, while preserving natural capital. However, further real scale and long-term experiments are needed to validate cork's potential as an “internal” OC source for NBS. © 2018\",\n",
       " \"In today's ongoing urbanization and escalating climate change, there is an increasing demand on cities to be innovative and inclusive to handle these emerging issues. As an answer to these challenges, and in order to generate and adopt sustainable innovations and naturebased solutions in the urban areas, the concept of urban living labs has emerged. However, to date, there is confusion concerning the concept of the urban living lab and its key components. Some interpret the urban living lab as an approach, others as a single project, and some as a specific place - and some just do not know. In order to unravel this complexity and better understand this concept, we sought to identify the key components of an urban living lab by discussing the perspective of city representatives in the context of an urban living lab project. To achieve this goal, we reviewed previous literature on this topic and carried out two workshops with city representatives, followed by an open-ended questionnaire. In this article, we identify and discuss seven key components of an urban living lab: Governance and management structure; financing models; urban context; nature-based solutions; partners and users (including citizens); approach; and ICT and infrastructure. We also offer an empirically derived definition of the urban living lab concept. © 2019 Carleton University. All Rights Reserved.\",\n",
       " \"Climate change vulnerability and social marginalisation are often interrelated in and through environments. Variations in climate change adaptation practice and research account for such social-ecological relations to varying degrees. Advocates of ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation (EbA) claim that it delivers social co-benefits to marginalised groups, although scant empirical evidence supports such claims. I investigate these claims in two EbA interventions in Sri Lanka, interpreting social benefits through an empowerment lens. I use qualitative methods such as focus groups and narrative interviews to study the conduct and context of the interventions. In both cases, marginalised people's own empowered adaptive strategies reflect how power relations and vulnerabilities relate to dynamic ecologies. The findings show that EbA enabled social benefits for marginalised groups, especially through support to common-pool resource management institutions and the gendered practices of home gardens. Such conduct was embedded within, but mostly peripheral to, broader and deeper contestations of power. Nevertheless, projects acted as platforms for renegotiating these power relations, including through acts of resistance. The results call for greater recognition of the ways that marginalised groups relate to ecology within empowered adaptive strategies, whilst also highlighting the need to recognise the diverse interests and power relations that cut across the conduct and contexts of these nominally ecosystem-based interventions. © 2019 by the author.\",\n",
       " 'We test an innovative approach to beneficially re-use dredged sediment to enhance salt marsh development. A Mud Motor is a dredged sediment disposal in the form of a semi-continuous source of mud in a shallow tidal channel allowing natural processes to disperse the sediment to nearby mudflats and salt marshes. We describe the various steps in the design of a Mud Motor pilot: numerical simulations with a sediment transport model to explore suitable disposal locations, a tracer experiment to measure the transport fate of disposed mud, assessment of the legal requirements, and detailing the planning and technical feasibility. An extensive monitoring and research programme was designed to measure sediment transport rates and the response of intertidal mudflats and salt marshes to an increased sediment load. Measurements include the sediment transport in the tidal channel and on the shallow mudflats, the vertical accretion of intertidal mudflats and salt marsh, and the salt marsh vegetation cover and composition. In the Mud Motor pilot a total of 470,516 m3 of fine grained sediment (D50 of ∼10 μm) was disposed over two winter seasons, with an average of 22 sediment disposals per week of operation. Ship-based measurements revealed a periodic vertical salinity stratification that is inverted compared to a classical estuary and that is working against the asymmetric flood-dominated transport direction. Field measurements on the intertidal mudflats showed that the functioning of the Mud Motor, i.e. the successful increased mud transport toward the salt marsh, is significantly dependent on wind and wave forcing. Accretion measurements showed relatively large changes in surface elevation due to deposition and erosion of layers of watery mud with a thickness of up to 10 cm on a time scale of days. The measurements indicate notably higher sediment dynamics during periods of Mud Motor disposal. The salt marsh demonstrated significant vertical accretion though this has not yet led to horizontal expansion because there was more hydrodynamic stress than foreseen. In carrying out the pilot we learned that the feasibility of a Mud Motor depends on an assessment of additional travel time for the dredger, the effectiveness on salt marsh growth, reduced dredging volumes in a port, and many other practical issues. Our improved understanding on the transport processes in the channel and on the mudflats and salt marsh yields design lessons and guiding principles for future applications of sediment management in salt marsh development that include a Mud Motor approach. © 2018 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Mountain social-ecological systems (SES) supply important ecosystem services that are threatened by climate change. In mountain SES there is a paradox between high community capacity to cope with extremes, and governance structures and processes that constrain that capacity from being realised. Climate adaptation that maintains livelihoods and supply of ecosystem services can catalyse this innate adaptive capacity if new adaptive governance arrangements can be created. Using the French Alps as a case study, we outline a participative framework for transformative adaptation that links adaptive capacity and governance to provide social innovation and ecosystem-based adaptation solutions for mountain SES. Grassland management was the main entry point for adaptation: bundles of adaptation services supplied by the landscape mosaic of biodiverse grassland types can maintain agricultural production and tourism and facilitate income diversification. Deliberate management for core adaptation services like resilient fodder production, erosion control, shade or aesthetic value generates co-benefits for future transformation ability. People activate bundles of adaptation services along adaptation pathways and realise benefits via co-production with other forms of capital including traditional knowledge or social networks. Common and distinctive adaptation services in each pathway create options for transformation if barriers from interactions between values and rules across scales can be overcome. For example conserving mown terraces which is a critical adaptation nexus reflects a complex interplay of values, markets and governance instruments from local to European scales. We conclude that increasing stakeholders capacity to mobilise adaptation services is critical for empowering them to implement adaptation to global change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Following severe flooding in 2007, a decision was taken in 2012 to explore nature-based solutions in 250-km2 river catchment in the southern Cotswolds in the United Kingdom. The project involves working with landowners to create in channel, riparian, field, and woodland structures aimed at attenuating high flows or increasing infiltration rates to reduce flood risk. After 3\\xa0years, it is clear that the threshold for effectiveness requires the implementation of measures throughout large areas of the upstream catchment. Early results suggest that social, as well as natural, capital has been enhanced through the project. What is clear is the beneficial role of working with multiple stakeholders to implement natural flood management on a catchment wide scale. In this sense, the project has adopted a comanagement approach that brings together the knowledge of hydrologists, ecologists, farmers, woodland owners, and the local community to implement locally agreed solutions within a broader project framework. This paper will outline the initial findings and the governance structure within a theoretical framework of comanagement and suggest how this type of framework is suitable for a range of nature-based solutions across Europe. However, the challenge remains in capturing the multiple benefits that such projects offer as these are often missed through conventional approaches such as cost–benefit analysis.

This paper aims to explore how landscape planning and governance research can contribute to the identification, design and implementation of NBS, using the example of water-related challenges in the landscape of the Lahn river in Germany. The objectives are (i) to introduce the NBS concept and to provide a concise definition for application in planning research, (ii) to explore how landscape planning and governance research might support a targeted use and implementation of NBS, and (iii) to propose an agenda for further research and practical experimentation. Our methods include a focused literature review and conceptual framework development. We define NBS as actions that alleviate a well-defined societal challenge (challenge-orientation), employ ecosystem processes of spatial, blue and green infrastructure networks (ecosystem processes utilization), and are embedded within viable governance or business models for implementation (practical viability). Our conceptual framework illustrates the functions of NBS in social-ecological landscape systems, and highlights the complementary contributions of landscape planning and governance research in developing and implementing NBS. Finally, a research and experimentation agenda is proposed, focusing on knowledge gaps in the effectiveness of NBS, useful approaches for informed co-design of NBS, and options for implementation. Insights from this paper can guide further studies and support testing of the NBS concept in practice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is one of the main environmental impacts of urbanization, affecting directly human health and well-being of the city dwellers, and also contributing to worsen environmental quality. As a key strategy to address sustainable urban development, the EU has advocated the development of Nature-Based solutions, such as the implementation of Green Infrastructure (GI), which can deliver a wide range of Regulating Ecosystem Services (ES). In this article, the ES of climate regulation provided by GI has been analyzed in the Municipality of Rome, Italy, characterized by a complex territory and by a Mediterranean climate. The methodological approach allowed to characterize the UHI and to analyze its features in a spatially explicit way and on a seasonal basis, through the Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from Landsat-8 data. The cooling capacity of different GI elements (peri-urban forest, urban forest, street trees), as well as the effect of vegetation cover and tree diversity on the provision of this regulating ES were assessed. The results show that GI significantly mitigates the hot urban climate during summer, with an effect that is dependent on the GI element and the environmental constrains to which it is exposed. NDVI and tree cover resulted the main indicators of the provision of the ES of climate regulation, highlighting that GI elements such as urban and peri-urban forests have the highest potential to provide this ES in a Mediterranean city. In the context of the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) process, our results lend support to claims that GI is important for an ecosystem-based climate adaptation strategy in urban environments, contributing to the definition of knowledge based criteria and indicators, relevant for decision-making in Mediterranean cities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Therefore, the development of proper strategies for the management of environmental risks will be crucial to ensure their liveability. Against this backdrop, concepts such as territorial resilience and Social-Ecological Systems (SES) can support the prioritisation of protective efforts. This paper presents a conceptual framework to be applied to areas subject to natural hazards. Its aim is to support the integration of different measures, with a special focus on protection forests and other Nature-based Solutions, into current risk management strategies. The framework considers (i) the definition of SES boundaries; (ii) the identification of the main goals to be achieved; (iii) the quantification of the supply and demand of the ecosystem protection service; and (iv) the development of risk management strategies able to include the management of protection forests among the adopted solutions. This framework is intended as a tool to be adopted by local and regional decision-makers as a tool to identify the areas at risk, to recognise the potential role of protection forests, and to operationalise the concept of resilience through the deployment of \"grey-green\" strategies. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",

This paper is a meta-study of the current state of spatial planning practice in South Africa, with special focus on nature-based solutions and green infrastructure planning. The complexities and perceptions relating to green infrastructure planning in South Africa is presented, based on the findings of nine independent studies conducted between 2014 and 2018. The collective interpretation of these findings are thematically reported on in terms of (i) the concept of Green Infrastructure as perceived from a local perspective, ii2) the functionality of green infrastructure in local (urban and rural) context, (iii) the benefits (and value) of green infrastructure in local context which probe to be contradicting international accepted theory, and (iv) long term planning strategies and opportunities relating to green infrastructure provision in South Africa and Africa. The paper emphasizes the importance of context-based planning based on the unique considerations illustrated in the (South) African case studies which amongst others disproved the green compensation hypothesis and disproved the green proximity principle. As a result, the paper calls on long-term strategies to align green infrastructure as part of mainstream spatial planning approaches, along with value capturing approaches to sensitize decision-makers to prioritize green infrastructure within broader land-use planning approaches. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",

Imminent climate change is predicted to intensify these consequences, forcing cities to rethink common infrastructure practices. One popular method of adaptation is green infrastructure implementation, which has been found to reduce local temperatures and alleviate excess runoff when installed effectively. As cities continue to change and adapt, land use/landcover modeling becomes an important tool for city officials in planning future land usage. This study uses a combination of cellular automata, machine learning, and Markov chain analysis to predict high resolution land use/landcover changes in Philadelphia, PA, USA for the year 2036. The 2036 landcover model assumes full implementation of Philadelphia’s green infrastructure program and past temporal trends of urbanization. The methodology used to create the 2036 model was validated by creating an intermediate prediction of a 2015 landcover that was then compared to an existing 2015 landcover. The accuracy of the validation was determined using Kappa statistics and disagreement scores. The 2036 model successfully met Philadelphia’s green infrastructure goals. A variety of landscape metrics demonstrated an overall decrease in fragmentation throughout the landscape due to increases in urban landcover. © 2019 by the authors.

To quantify soil CO2 efflux, field experiments were conducted in situ (2015–2017) with an LCi-SC soil CO2 flux system under three semi-arid ecosystems in the Mediterranean as one of the main identified climate change hotspot. Mean values of Rs rates showed that soil CO2 effluxes were significantly different among various terrestrial ecosystems with higher Rs in semi-natural ecosystems as under Steppe 1.739 ± 0.717 μmol CO2 m–2 s–1 (658.093 ± 271.336 g C m−2 yr−1) and under Forest 4.205 ± 1.731 μmol CO2 m–2 s–1 (1591.307 ± 655.066 g C m−2 yr−1) than under the natural ecosystem Garrigue 0.914 ± 0.309 μmol CO2 m–2 s–1 (345.887 ± 116.935 g C m−2 yr−1). It appears that soil CO2 efflux is highly ecosystem-specific, so it is required to be verified across ecosystem types.We recorded a very strong relationship between Ts and Ws, as documented by the correlation coefficient (r = –0.848), respectively R-squared (71.908%).

       " 'The inexorable extension of urbanization is consuming huge amounts of soil drastically reducing natural vegetation, replacing it with buildings and low albedo surfaces. The changes due to the different thermal properties of surface materials and the lack of evapotranspiration in urban areas lead to a phenomenon known as \"urban heat island effect\". By reintroducing the vegetation back into the urban landscape, a partnership between nature and cities should be strengthened to create a new sustainable urban environment. Since the outer surfaces of building offer a great amount of space for vegetation, planting on roofs and walls has become one of the most innovative way to provide several environmental services. Moreover, all the green infrastructures, such as urban gardens or nature areas, that form an important part of cityscapes, could ensure also a thermal isolation and constitute a sustainable energy saving solution for buildings.

       " 'Natural rivers in urban areas bear significant potential to provide ecosystem services for the surrounding inhabitants. However, surface sealing by houses and street networks, urban drainage, disposal of waste and wastewater resulting from advancing urbanization usually lead to the deterioration of urban rivers and their riparian areas. This ultimately damages their ability to provide ecosystem services. This paper presents an innovative methodology for a rapid and low-cost assessment of the ecological status of urban rivers and riparian areas in developing countries under data scarce conditions. The methodology uses a combination of field data and freely available high-resolution satellite images to assess three ecological status categories: river hydromorphology, water quality, and riparian land cover. The focus here is on the assessment of proxies for biophysical structures and processes representing ecological functioning that enable urban rivers and riparian areas to provide ecosystem services. These proxies represent a combination of remote sensing land cover- and field-based indicators. Finally, the three ecological status categories are combined to quantify the potential of different river sections to provide regulating ecosystem services. The development and application of the methodology is demonstrated and visualized for each 100 m section of the Pochote River in the City of León, Nicaragua. This spatially distributed information of the ecosystem service potential of individual sections of the urban river and riparian areas can serve as important information for decision making regarding the protection, future use, and city development of these areas, as well as the targeted and tailor-made development of nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure. © 2019 by the authors.',\n",

Chrysanthemum zawadskii var. latilobum (A-CL) and Aquilegia flabellata var. pumila (A-AP) respectively were planted in each type A bioretention reactors while Rhododendron indicum linnaeus (B-RL) and Spiraea japonica (B-SJ), respectively were planted in each type B bioretention reactors. Results revealed that the four lab-scale bioretention reactors significantly reduced the influent total suspended load by about 89 to 94% (p < 0.01). Type B-RL and B-SJ reactors reduced soluble Cr, Cu, Zn, and Pb by 28 to 45% that were 15 to 35% greater than the soluble metal reduction of type A-CL and A-AP reactors, respectively. Among the pollutants, total Cr attained the greatest discharged fraction of 0.52-0.81. Excluding the effect of soil media, total Pb attained the greatest retention fraction in the bioretention systems amounting to 0.15-0.34. Considering the least discharge fraction of heavy metal in the bioretention system, it was observed that the bioretention systems achieved effectual reduction in terms of total Cu, Zn and Pb. These findings were associated with the poor adsorption capacity of the soil used in each bioretention system. The results of this study may be used for estimating the maintenance requirements of bioretention systems. © 2019 Techno-Press, Ltd.',\n",
       " 'Rocinha (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is the largest favela in South America. It is located on a steep mountain slope in the Tijuca National Park with a population of over 160,000 living in poor environmental, health and hygiene conditions. The geomorphological and urban setting of Rocinha makes it vulnerable to natural hazards, with the greatest risk posed by flooding or landslides, compromising the precarious balance between ecosystem services (ES) provision and human well-being. The paper aims to assess and map ES provision in a context where available data to identify areas vulnerable to natural risks is limited. The ES analyses were adapted to the specific socio-economic and environmental context of favelas, which are characterised by dense, continuously built-up environment and a high proportion of impervious surfaces, leading to deteriorating environmental, health and hygiene conditions over time. The ES-based approach was pivotal for setting out strategies-including nature-based solutions (NBS)-to mitigate disaster risk and increase local resilience. These strategies were selected taking into account the context of Rocinha and feasibility. The research shows that ES assessment can be the starting point for projects based on NBS with a view to increasing resilience even in environmentally critical contexts. © 2018 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'In recent years, a noticeable contradiction has emerged between the disorderly sprawl and fragile climate environment of many cities, especially in mountainous cities. Therefore, this paper respectively constructed evaluation indicators for urban sprawl sustainability (USS) and climate change adaptability (CCA). Next, a coupling coordination degree model was used to measure the coordinated development of USS and CCA. Finally, this paper analyzed the coordinated development type of USS and CCA in the Chongqing metropolitan area from 2007 to 2017. The results of this paper show that USS and CCA have gradually shifted to coordinated development in the Chongqing metropolitan area during the study period. However, there were obvious regional differences in the type of coordinated development in the Chongqing metropolitan area. The coordinated development degree of USS and CCA in nine districts ranged from 0.635 to 0.721 in 2017. It can be divided into three types: slightly coordinated development with lagging CCA; slightly coordinated development with lagging USS; and moderately coordinated development with lagging CCA. Those districts should give priority to the use of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), and multi-center and multi-group approaches to enhance the coordinated development between USS and CCA, which is also helpful for mountainous cities in China and other countries. © 2018 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied “Sponge City” plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a depth of 0.10–0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63–98.35% and inundation extents by 26.09–82.41%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40–1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04–0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'The ability of a soil to sustain infiltration rates and to attenuate pollutants is critical for the design and operation of Managed Aquifer Recharge/Soil Aquifer Treatment and phyto-treatment schemes, also referred to as “Blue Infrastructures”. We investigated the buffering capacity of a sediment sample and a peat soil sample for nutrients and selected pharmaceutical compounds and its evolution under continuous infiltration of secondary treated wastewater (TWW) in column experiments. Samples were obtained from two blue infrastructures, the Sant’Alessio Induced River Bank Filtration plant and the San Niccolò large-scale phyto-treatment plant in Italy, and were mainly different in their organic carbon contents (0.9 and 48%, respectively). In the column experiments, a constant infiltration rate of about 0.5\\xa0L/d was maintained for 6\\xa0months. After 4\\xa0months of operation, diclofenac and carbamazepine were spiked into the TWW to evaluate their fate. Water quality was monitored by periodic water sampling from the column inflow, at sampling ports along the column length, and at the outflow. Hydraulic conductivity (K) was also monitored. The hydraulic conductivity of the Sant’Alessio sediment decreased by a factor of 10 during the first 10\\xa0days of infiltration and then stabilized, while for the San Niccolò K (initially lower) remained constant for 50\\xa0days until it decreased following a change of the redox condition in the column. The different redox conditions, due to the two different soils tested, influenced also the concentration and mobility of PO 4 3− , Fe, Mn, and NPOC, and the speciation of the redox sensitive elements (nitrogen and sulfur). NOPC and phosphate were enriched during the filtration through San Niccolò peat soil (from 2 to 4 times, respectively), while they were buffered by the Sant’Alessio sediment (from 0.2 to 0.4 times, respectively). Diclofenac removal (69% and below 20% for San Niccolò and Sant’Alessio, respectively) was related to sorption and degradation processes and it was lower than the removal of carbamazepine in both soils (76 and 35%). The buffer capacity differences between the two soils were higher for diclofenac (62%) than carbamazepine (35%). Nevertheless, since no apparent degradation of carbamazepine was detected in both soils, its persistence in the soil may have a larger impact in case of desorption, posing contamination risk to groundwater. The results highlight the importance of the soils or sediments to be used as medium in such nature-based solutions for their operations. They also offer an approach to, e.g., tailor man-made soil layers in infiltration basins. We strongly suggest that soil characteristics and test duration are carefully considered in designing these infrastructures, when nature-based processes are the choice for dealing with reuse of treated wastewater management issues. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'The water resources-water environment carrying capacity (WR-WECC) is an important indicator for judging the regional macro-control ability of water resources. The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is related closely to sustainability, harmonious and green development, resources rational exploitation, coupled human and environment, and ecological protection priority. Participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and/or village environmental committees; while in the case of water management, a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association, domestic water committees, cooperative societies, and various water user groups. The WR-WECC evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade‐offs. To realize the development and utilization of water resources, water ecological conservation, and water environment protection in Yuetang District, we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources, water environment and water ecological characteristics, applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of WR-WECC, and explore a deep-seated reason based on NBS. The WR-WECC evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource, socioeconomic, and eco-environmental systems. We used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software and adopted the improved PCA to integrate the urban economic-social-ecological development of the Xiangjiang (a tributary of the Yangtze River) River Basin. We applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of WR-WECC of Yuetang District from 2005 to 2015 based on NBS. The WR-WECC of Yuetang District was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate, the water use amount per ten thousand Yuan gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita water resources. In addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011, the WR-WECC in Yuetang District was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level, regional water environment comprehensive management, and awareness of water ecological protection. The WR-WECC of the Yuetang District in 2013–2015 was in a Class I (excellent) condition. The temporal variations analysis based on NBS was proposed through a combination of economic-social-ecological values provided by nature-based development and utilization patterns. Based on the relationship among regional water resources, economic society, and eco-environment protection, the paper supplied a WR-WECC improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water-rich area in south China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) stormwater systems, also known as Low Impact Development (LID) systems or Nature Based Solutions (NBS), are currently implemented based on the underlying assumption of statistical stationarity of rainfall, which threatens to become outdated under climatic uncertainty. This paper applies a new downscaling method to examine the implications of climate change on future rainfall and evaluate the reliability of WSUD stormwater infrastructure in pollution reduction, flow frequency mitigation and reliability as an alternative water supply. A variety of future atmospheric scenarios are considered as part of this comprehensive assessment by analysing an ensemble of eight different downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs). High resolution catchment-scale rainfall projections for Melbourne, Australia were generated using a scheme called High-resolution Downscaling of Rainfall Using STEPS (HiDRUS) at a fine 1 km and 6-min scale for more precise analysis with uncertainty estimates. Statistical analyses show that, in general, the climate models predict a drier future with fewer rainfall events and longer dry periods when comparing the simulated near future (2040–2049) periods against the base-line period (1995–2004). The difference simulated between historical and future rainfall projections show minimum difference of WSUD performance in pollution removal and flow frequency reduction, with slightly lower harvesting reliability (<3%) observed under future climate; high variabilities, however, were observed across GCM simulations, indicating big uncertainties of system reliability under various conditions, e.g. design wetland sizes may vary from 2.5% to 4.0% of the impervious catchment area according to different future projects across GCMs. Larger WSUD systems are recommended to ensure reliable performance of pollution removal, as well as harvesting reliability under simulated future conditions. The significance of considering an ensemble of different GCMs as opposed to many scenarios generated by a single ‘best’ climate model was also demonstrated for the robust estimation of uncertainty in future WSUD reliability. This work highlights important considerations for the future design, management and quantitative evaluation of WSUD reliability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Spatial planning of green infrastructure has become well established since the turn of the millennium. However, as a planning and policy concept alone it lacks the focus and immediacy that decision makers may be looking for to solve current problems associated with urban and extra-urban sustainability and resilience. In nature-based solutions decision makers can find the focus and immediacy they are seeking. We posit that these nature-based solutions used in combination with spatial green infrastructure planning have the capacity to rival, replace or combine with existing grey infrastructure approaches. Nevertheless, there is a major inhibitor of change to be overcome. This is ‘path dependence’ a concept where active memory conditioned by past decisions has a controlling influence on decision making. This concept leads to self-reinforcement that is detrimental to the creation of climate-sensitive infrastructure. Unless path dependence is broken through a combination of reforms, the shift towards the full adoption of nature-based solutions will not occur. A transition path covering four areas is proposed, which will help to overcome path dependence and lead to a greater use of nature-based solutions. We argue that the forum to debate these proposals is within the framework of UN Habitat. The Urban Thinkers Campus and World Urban Forum could be the fora for this exchange. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Urban Green Areas (UGAs) are Green Infrastructure (GI) elements widely known as a framework for applying Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), as they may preserve and increase environmental values in urbanized contexts by supporting a wide range of ecosystem services. Accessibility and usability of UGAs are important indicators of the environmental quality of urban areas to be considered in the sustainable governance, management, and design of metropolitan areas. In such a context, the present study aims at assessing accessibility and usability of UGAs from both old and new residential settlements of the 15 administrative units of the Rome municipality, considered an exemplificative case of a Mediterranean city which, in recent decades, has been subjected to a rapid transition from a ‘compact growth’ model to a more ‘dispersed’ one. Firstly, we used the European Urban Atlas geodatabase to identify and map residential areas, including those established between 2006 and 2012. Secondly, we performed a network analysis to assess the distance between urban settlements and the closest UGA access point. Ancillary data were used to check the presence of facilities and therefore to assess the usability of UGAs. 57% of residential settlements have accessible UGAs in their surroundings, but the percentage is much lower (25%) if we consider those established between 2006 and 2012. This evidence was also found at administrative unit scale. Equally, the share of population that can benefit from accessible UGAs is lower in the new settlements, notably in the more peripheral administrative units. The usability of accessible UGAs exceeds 80% in the whole study area. The proposed methodology could be applied in similar contexts, as a useful tool for urban planners and decision makers to (i) support the assessment of the quality of life of people living in new residential settlements; (ii) design new UGAs in order to increase accessibility to green spaces, and therefore the value of newly built-up areas. The implications of, future perspectives of and need for sustainable urban planning in the light of the NBS framework are reported and discussed. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'The phenomenon of increased temperature in cities compared to their rural environs, also referred to as urban heat island, is one of the most evident anthropogenic climatic modifications. Introducing green spaces and vegetation is the fastest, simplest, and a highly effective way of mitigating and adapting urban temperature conditions. The primary goal of the presented research is to identify the interrelationship between urban heat island magnitude (UHIM) and urban green infrastructure extent, shape, and distribution on European scale comparing different green space planning traditions – planning families (PFs). The UHIM for the European cities was calculated based on a reconstructed MODIS LST dataset of a period of ten years. The reasons for the arrangement of UHIMs according to PFs and green land use are not easily explained and are certainly influenced by a number of various conditions in different PFs. UHIM increases with the longitude of cities. In some of the PFs, the relation between the UHIM and land use proportion is characteristic for certain land uses, but a considerable difference between PFs regarding land use proportion with significant impact on UHIM can only be noted in case of a forest. The configuration and composition of the forest correlate with UHIM with statistical significance, but the share of the forest does not affect UHI in all PFs in the same way. While a higher proportion of forest, higher largest patch index, higher mean patch area, higher edge density and higher proportional landscape core is associated with a lower UHIM in the New member and Mediterranean PFs, the relationship in other PFs is reversed. Information on general patterns of UHIM occurrence in relation to urban green infrastructure characteristics could help urban planners and politicians introduce changes on the local level, which would help providing nature-based solutions for the mitigation of the UHI phenomenon. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'Target 2 of the European Biodiversity Strategy promotes the maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem services <(ES) as well as the restoration of at least 15% of degraded ecosystems by creating green infrastructure (GI). The purpose of the this research is to present a GI proposal that combines the delivery of regulating services with the restoration and ecological reconnection of urban forests and trees in a densely urbanised context. The project area covers about 3 000 ha in the urban sector of the metropolitan area of Rome and the GI components consist of 533 ha of areal green spaces and of more than 500 km of road verges. Planned interventions include forest restoration and tree plantations, with a varying service supply according to type and condition of the different components. Potential natural vegetation (PNV) models and dispersal potential of representative forest species, together with structural and functional vegetation models for the enhancement of air pollutants removal, guided the selection of the species to be promoted and of the planting pattern. Environmental benefits of the proposal include more than 30 ha of restored urban forests, about 15 000 planted individuals of native oaks, a sevenfold improvement in ecological connectivity and halved isolation between green spaces. On the other hand, the expected socio-economic benefits include almost 300 000 potential beneficiaries of the improved air quality and avoided costs for damages to human health that range between 40 700 and 130 200 EUR per year. Notwithstanding their preliminary character, these estimates allowed the proposal to highlight the relationship between GI and public health. Moreover, they showed the economic and social effectiveness of nature-based solutions in comparison with further development of grey infrastructure.

This study aims to estimate abundance, coverage and average size of GSB in Italy through the integration of inventory and cartographic data, even considering GSB patches smaller than 0.5 ha. GSB were classified according to their type (forested and non-forested), canopy cover and location with respect to population density (from thinly to densely populated areas). We refer to built-up areas instead urban, thus including, for example, road infrastructures, buildings and sparse settlements in rural areas, otherwise neglected. Results show that 43.5% of built-up areas in Italy is unsealed, of which more than 18% is covered by GSB, mainly dominated by forested ones. Results also reveal that the number of forested GSB, their coverage and average patch size decrease with the increase of the population density, while their canopy cover follows the opposite trend. Main findings demonstrate that the proposed approach provides reliable GSB estimates to better understand interactions between humans and nature along an urban-rural gradient, thus representing a valuable support towards the implementation of Nature-Based Solutions in urban planning. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH',\n",
       " 'Compared to technical infrastructure, nature-based solutions (NBS) strive to work with nature and to move beyond business-as-usual practices. Despite decades of research from various academia fields and a commencing mainstreaming of the term, a lack of cohesiveness and pertinent methods regarding the subject matter hinders further implementation. Using a functional landscape approach, this paper aims to identify the spatial extent of existing and potential NBS locations and applies it across a case study in Germany. Inspired by hydrological models, which work with delineated hydrological response units, this research instead defines hydromorphological landscape units (HLU) based on biophysical spatial criteria to identify the potential areas that could function as NBS. This approach was tested for floodplain-based NBS. The identified HLU were then compared with historical floodplain and land-use data to differentiate between active or potential NBS. The spatial delineation identified 3.6 million hectares of already active floodplains areas, for which we recommend continued or modified protection measures, and 0.4 million ha where the hydromorphological conditions are apt to support floodplains, yet are cut-offfrom the flooding regime and require rehabilitation measures. The identification of NBS through explicitly defined HLU serves as a spatial approach to support NBS implementation. Taken together, our research can provide an essential contribution to systemize the emerging scholarship on NBS in river landscapes and to help in selecting and planning appropriate NBS in practice. © 2018 by the authors.',\n",
       " \"Academic interest in rewilding is moving from commentary to discussion on future research agendas. The quality of rewilding research design will be enhanced if it is informed by knowledge of the rewilding practice. Here, we describe the conceptual origins and six case study examples of a mode of rewilding that emerged in the Dutch Delta and is being promoted and supported by Rewilding Europe, an umbrella organization established in 2011. The case experiences presented help position this version of rewilding in relation to the US 3C's version and point towards a rewilding action philosophy characterized by pragmatic realism and pioneer projects around which multiactor networks interested in policy innovation and change form. We argue that scaling-up the models of rewilding presented is constrained by institutional cultures and will require innovations in conservation finance and business models. Nonetheless, we suggest that the expanding European Rewilding Network and associated facilities, such as the European Wildlife Bank, represent a valuable asset for natural science research, aimed at exploring the ecological impacts of grazing and the relationship between role of restored herbivore guilds and biotical expansion, and for social science research investigating concepts such as non-human agency and autonomy. Lastly, we ask applied scientists to view rewilding as an uncertain and unfolding conservation approach and to refrain from seeking to specify it as a management approach supporting the delivery of pre-determined targets and/or ideals. This is because such actions may constrain the transformative potential of rewilding practice. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.\",\n",
       " 'In rivers and stream migration barriers do not only fragment watersheds, but also significantly alter and impact habitat quality by impounding running waters over numerous kilometers in the gentle sloping Dutch landscape. Degraded riparian zones caused by agriculture right up to the banks of streams and rivers and reduced variability in landscape structure by large-scale land use both act as migration bottlenecks resulting from habitat alteration and simplification. Across Europe much restoration effort is directed towards improving fish migration by installing fish passes near barriers. We consider this scope too unbalanced and plead for improving habitat quality and migration pathways based on the requirements for a wide range of aquatic species, Viz considering river basins as ecological networks do not only encompass whether species are able to migrate but also requires attention to the type and quality of habitats. Riparian zones affect light, temperature and coarse organic material in streams and are essential migration pathways for adult life stages of aquatic insects. Moreover, land bridges between the capillaries in watersheds facilitate the recolonization by air from source populations. Improving instream conditions, riparian zones and even the wider landscape around the upstream sources are required for aquatic biota e.g. fish and insects with an aquatic larval and terrestrial adult life stage depend on a suit of different habitats to fulfil their life cycle. Opportunities and requirements to restore or improve of these habitats may thus be situated outside rivers or streams. Wetlands along rivers and streams and in the upstream capillaries of watersheds are examples of such key habitats for improving the ecological status but receive too little attention as effective restoration measures. The main cause is these wetlands being situated outside the boundaries of for the EU Water Framework Directive designated water bodies which requires support and agreement with multiple stakeholders. We therefore plead for a complementary suit of restoration measures such as dam removal and wetland restoration along streams and small rivers for improving habitat conditions and migration over land and by air. A recent inventory identified 30 examples of dam removal in the Netherlands. One of the largest initiatives comprises the restoration of the mouths of numerous tributaries of the river Meuse for upstream migration and habitat improvement. Nature-based solutions to improve riparian zones encompass amongst others sediment suppletion and wood addition to streams and have recently gained momentum. This reconnects the stream to its valley. On the other hand, increasing landscape structure variability around the headwaters from a stream ecological perspective is till now hardly practiced. © 2019 Werkgemeenschap Landschapsecologisch Onderzoek.

       " 'In the effort to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food, health, water, and climate, an increase in pressure on land is highly likely. To avoid further land degradation and promote land restoration, multifunctional use of land is needed within the boundaries of the soil-water system. In addition, awareness-raising, a change in stakeholders\\' attitudes, and a change in economics are essential. The attainment of a balance between the economy, society, and the biosphere calls for a holistic approach. In this paper, we introduce four concepts that we consider to be conducive to realizing LDN in a more integrated way: systems thinking, connectivity, nature-based solutions, and regenerative economics. We illustrate the application of these concepts through three examples in agricultural settings. Systems thinking lies at the base of the three others, stressing feedback loops but also delayed responses. Their simultaneous use will result in more robust solutions, which are sustainable from an environmental, societal, and economic point of view. Solutions also need to take into account the level of scale (global, national, regional, local), stakeholders\\' interests and culture, and the availability and boundaries of financial and natural capital. Furthermore, sustainable solutions need to embed short-term management in long-term landscape planning. In conclusion, paradigm shifts are needed. First, it is necessary to move from excessive exploitation in combination with environmental protection, to sustainable use and management of the soil-water system. To accomplish this, new business models in robust economic systems are needed based on environmental systems thinking; an approach that integrates environmental, social, and economic interests. Second, it is necessary to shift from a \"system follows function\" approach towards a \"function follows system\" one. Only by making the transition towards integrated solutions based on a socio-economical-ecological systems analysis, using concepts such as nature-based solutions, do we stand a chance to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality by 2030. To make these paradigm shifts, awareness-raising in relation to a different type of governance, economy and landscape and land-use planning and management is needed. © 2018 by the authors.',\n",

       " 'Context: The study of ecosystem services has extended its influence into spatial planning and landscape ecology, the integration of which can offer an opportunity to enhance the saliency, credibility, and legitimacy of landscape ecology in spatial planning issues. Objectives: This paper presents a conceptual framework suitable for spatial planning in human dominated environments supported by landscape ecological thinking. It seeks to facilitate the integration of ecosystem services into current practice, including landscape metrics as suitable indicators. Methods: A literature review supported the revision of existing open questions pertaining to ecosystem services as well as their integration into landscape ecology and spatial planning. A posterior reflection of the current state-of-the-art was then used as a basis for developing the spatial planning conceptual framework. Results and conclusion: The framework is articulated around four phases (characterisation, assessment, design, and monitoring) and three concepts (character, service, and value). It advocates integration of public participation, consideration of “landscape services”, the inclusion of ecosystem disservices, and the use of landscape metrics for qualitative assessment of services. As a result, the framework looks to enhance spatial planning practice by providing: (i) a better consideration of landscape configuration in the supply of services (ii) the integration of anthropogenic services with ecosystem services; (iii) the consideration of costs derived from ecosystems (e.g. disservices); and (iv) an aid to the understanding of ecosystem services terminology for spatial planning professionals and decision makers. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.',\n",

Upland peatlands are source areas of flooding but there is lack of understanding of how different rainfall intensities and temporal patterns may interact with land-cover configurations to influence flood peaks. Using spatially distributed (SD-) TOPMODEL we investigated these interactions for a case study peatland catchment. For each of four rainfall depths ranging from 20 mm to 50 mm, four storm rainfall patterns were applied (rainfall that was uniform, rainfall with an early peak intensity during the storm, middle peak and late peak). Late peak rainfall resulted in the highest river flow peaks at the catchment outlet studied, followed by middle and early rainfall peak patterns, while uniform rainfall through time gave the lowest flow peaks. A key factor was synchroneity of overland flow movement and concentration. The impact on river flow peaks of land-cover change on riparian zones and on gentle gradient slopes was larger than that for other parts of the catchment under different rainfall intensities and patterns. The impacts of land-cover change on proportional change in flood peaks in these sensitive areas became smaller when rainfall intensity increased, but absolute changes in flow peaks became larger. Land-cover change in sensitive areas under middle and late peak rainfall had a larger impact on river flow peaks than for early peak rainfall. It was possible to identify the ‘worst’ rainfall patterns for a particular case of land-cover change which may be useful for practitioners to help manage expectations of flood response to nature-based solutions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"Bielsko Lake is large (257.9 ha) and deep (max. depth 23 m, mean depth 6.2 m) lake, located in the Pomerania Region, serving as a receiver of treated municipal sewage as well as stormwater, from the town of Biały Bór. Deterioration of water quality has been observed in recent years – the lake was still a in moderate state (III class) in 1997, but now it is in a poor condition (IV class) with low Secchi depth (to 0.3 m), high chlorophyll-a content (up to 153 μg dm−3) and cyanobacterial water bloom in summer, dominated by Planktothrix agardhii, Aphanizomenon gracile, Planktolyngbya limnetica and Pseudanabaena limnetica. External nutrient load exceeds 3.4 times the permissible TN load and 2.4 times TP load, according to Vollenweider's criteria. To improve the ecological state of Bielsko Lake protective measures against pollution have been proposed. Treated municipal sewage should be diverted from the lake by the transport to specially prepared filtering fields, which will drain the sewage into the ground. Stormwater should be treated in a sedimentation and biofiltration system before being discharged to the lake. As internal loading from bottom sediments is very high, sustainable restoration was also proposed. Soluble reactive phosphorus in the water column could be inactivated using small and accurately calculated doses of iron sulfate and magnesium chloride. A cascading effect of trophic interactions of the food web on phytoplankton could be obtained using piscivorous fish stocking (biomanipulation method). © 2018 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences\",\n",

       " \"Due to an increase in poorly planned anthropogenic activities, the water quality of several Asian big rivers is highly being affected. Although the assessment of heavy metal contents is vital to develop and design sustainable water management plans, several areas in Central Asia such as Kazakhstan do not have recent studies available that evaluate this situation. One representative example of this lack of information is the Syr Darya River. Thus, this study carried out the first approach to a water quality assessment in Kazakhstan's Syr Darya River, where a massive expansion of irrigation canals, pastures in middle- and lower-reaches and an increase in industrialization and population have lowered its potential water capacity. To achieve this goal, various physicochemical parameters were analyzed for forty-three water samples along the river under dry weather conditions at 25 cm water depth. The obtained results were analyzed using standard methods (e.g., Multi N/C 2100 S analyzer or an atomic absorption spectrometer) and evaluated by multivariate techniques (cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NDMS)) and a heavy metal pollution index (HPI). In the CA, five cluster groups were obtained. It is important to remark that the first cluster consists of the highest number of water sampling points (8). The last cluster is made up of only one point, which shows the highest difference against the other sites in our model. The NDMS also confirmed that some specific points along the river are different. Five components were extracted from the PCA: (1) COD (chemical oxygen demand), Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Mn; (2) Cu, Cd, Ni and Co; (3) T (water temperature), pH and DO (dissolved oxygen); (4) T and Fe; and (5) COD and OC (organic carbon). The HPI showed very high values (279.9), which were locally confirmed in some hotspots close to the Aral Sea, industrialized areas and agricultural fields. Therefore, our results demonstrate that, under dry weather conditions, surface water resources could be mismanaged in the Syr Darya River in Kazakhstan in specific areas. For the future, considering the important role that agriculture and pasture play in the Kazakh economy, we insist upon the importance of applying water quality control measures applying nature-based solutions and efficient management plans. Moreover, we confirmed the necessity to conduct further research related to sampling under other weather situations such as wet and cold conditions, different river water depths and other locations considering specific land uses, for example, grazing, mining, railways or industries. © 2017 by the authors.\",\n",
       " 'Urban heat island (UHI) shows thermal intensification in urban areas compared to surrounding areas. Land surface temperature (LST) has been widely applied in assessing UHI. However, due to limitations of the LST retrieval method, few researchers attempted to track the long-term dynamics of UHI and their responses to progressive urbanization process based on Landsat series data. In this study, we improved the retrieval method to extract the average UHI intensity of Hangzhou city core in 1990–2010, and explored the dynamics of UHI composition and configuration in response to urbanization. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was applied to calculate the average UHI intensity in the study area. Hangzhou city core was heating up in study period with extensive conversions from neutral and cool area to heated area. The expansion of heated area initially radiated from the original urban core in linear configuration, and subsequently expanded to infill areas away from the core by replacing neutral and cool area. The significant differences in average UHI intensity between different land use and land cover (LULC) types can be observed: urban land had the highest value whereas forest and water body registered the lowest. The expansion of urban land at the expense of natural land had exceeded a threshold to induce spillover of heat energy from the former to the latter. The findings can inform nature-based solutions to optimize the thermal environment and livability of fast-growing subtropical cities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Hydrological connectivity describes the water-mediated transfer of mass, energy, and organisms between landscape elements and is the foundation for understanding how individual elements such as wetlands and streams integrate to support ecosystem services and nature-based solutions in the landscape. Hydrological connectivity of geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs)—that is, wetlands without persistent surface water connections—is particularly poorly understood. To better understand GIW hydrological connectivity, we use a novel chloride mass-balance approach to quantify the local runoff generation (defined as precipitation minus evapotranspiration, assuming negligible long-term water storage) for 260 GIW subcatchments across North America. To evaluate hydrological connectivity, we compare the estimated local runoff from GIW subcatchments with the catchment-average runoff. These comparisons provide three novel insights regarding the magnitude and variability of GIW hydrological connectivity. First, across 10 study regions, GIW subcatchments generate runoff at 120% of the mean catchment rate, implying they are well-connected elements of the larger hydrologic landscape. Second, there is substantial heterogeneity in runoff generation among GIW subcatchments, which may enable support for a wide array of ecosystem functions and services. Finally, observed heterogeneity in runoff generation was largely uncorrelated to simple linear geographic predictors, indicating that GIW landscape position cannot reliably predict hydrological connectivity. In stark contrast to a priori legal assumptions that GIWs exhibit low or no hydrological connectivity, our results suggest that GIW subcatchments are active landscape features in runoff generation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",
       " 'As the local strategic surface water source for Beijing City, the Miyun Reservoir catchment is suffering from the challenges of forest landscape degradation (FLD) under various natural and anthropogenic disturbances. This study developed a cause–effect Bayesian network model, consisting of three tiers of nodes, site indicators, external disturbance, and the outcome of FLD, to perform a regional ecological risk assessment to better understand the FLD risks (1998–2013) in the catchment. The effects of the Beijing–Tianjin sandstorm source control (BTSSC) Phase I program, a typical forest landscape restoration program, on the FLD were further examined. Overall, the higher level of either current occurrence or risk probability for FLD suggests the urgency of the following restoration efforts. The dominance of soil erosion for FLD indicates that soil erosion control should be a priority in the following Phase II program. Meanwhile, the uneven spatial distribution of high-risk areas suggests that the following efforts should be focused within the upstream Hebei Province. In addition, based on the comparison of site indicators between different risk areas, the study concluded that community livelihood activities and land degradation due to climate change have been the other two dominant driving forces contributing to FLD. Furthermore, the study found that the forest landscape has not been restored into the best state by the BTSSC program due to the multiple and complex challenges. Thus, the technical concept of nature-based solutions, including close-to-nature forest management technology and a comprehensive community-involvement governance model, was proposed for the following Phase II program. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",
       " 'Disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation are connected through a common goal: reducing the impacts of extreme events and increasing resilience to disasters, particularly among vulnerable populations. By coordinating adaptation and disaster risk management policies, multiple benefits can be achieved. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) offers a cost-effective adaptation and DRR at different scales and under multiple scenarios. EbA uses natural or managed ecosystem processes to increase resilience and adaptation to climate change. EbA delivers other benefits, including mitigating greenhouse gases, and improving biodiversity, water and air quality. These co-benefits can be the primary driver for implementation and reflect related policy objectives. EbA are also associated with different land use or habitat types (e.g. agriculture, forestry, coastal, urban, or freshwater ecosystems). This paper considers the lessons learnt from implementing EbA across a range of land uses. However, implementation frequently applies multiple measures across land uses and at varying scales. The evidence indicates that adaptation and DRR are achievable cost-effectively whilst providing important co-benefits. Demonstrating these co-benefits ensures both stakeholder support and funding opportunities. Further, the mainstreaming of nature-based solutions across policy areas linked to different co-benefits both increases the acceptability of EbA and also opens up multiple funding sources. Key to the success of EbA is the involvement of stakeholders throughout the implementation process; this can include demonstrating private benefits and utilising trusted intermediaries. However, gaps often remain in our knowledge of the biophysical and economic benefits, or negative impacts, of EbA indicating that research and monitoring remain a priority. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"Urban allotment gardens (UAGs) are important for the provision of foodstuffs, social cohesion, residents' well-being, and prevention of the formation of local heat islands during summer. The soils of these gardens however may be adversely affected by pollution threats and thus create health risks. In such cases, appropriate management becomes necessary. For several gardens exhibiting soil contamination (e.g., Pb at 100–400\\xa0mg\\xa0kg−1) in the city of Nantes, local actors collaborated, including scientists, the municipality's Parks and Open Space Department, elected officials, sanitary administration, and each site's gardeners' association. The soil characterization step was performed along with a sanitary risk evaluation and discussion of management options, based on both the pollution characteristics and local context. The most frequent option consisted of replacing the polluted soils with clean soils. Managing the excavated polluted soils on-site (e.g., for ornamental purposes) limited the economic and environmental impacts associated with this solution. Alternative solutions, including a combined system of nonaccumulative cropping vegetables at the time of phytoextraction, were also employed to maintain gardening uses. In some cases, land use (gardening) was changed into, for example, an orchard, open space, or ornamental space. A combination of solutions was introduced in several gardens. The various options available for managing polluted soils, as implemented in Nantes' UAGs and based mainly on nature-based solution, can be applied more generally in order to improve soil quality. In addition to enhancing the quality of both residents' lives and biodiversity, several solutions allow preserving or even restoring soil functions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\",\n",
       " 'In Nordic and Arctic regions, the rapidly warming climate sustains hydroclimatic and vegetation changes in the landscape. There is evidence for an increase in vegetation density in some regions, a trend that is expected as a response to increasing temperature and precipitation. If the hydroclimatic changes are linked to vegetation response, it could be viewed as a landscape-scale nature-based solution (NBS) that could moderate the runoff response, as denser vegetation should lead to increased evapotranspiration and lower runoff. In this paper, we investigate and compare hydroclimatic changes over a set of basins in the Nordic region and northwest America and compare with changes in vegetation density, analyzed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for three time periods: 1973–1978, 1993–1998, and 2013–2016. Over the period of the 1970s to 1990s, the hydroclimate became warmer and wetter and vegetation density increased, but over a later period from the 1990s to 2010s, vegetation density decreased, despite a continuing warming and wetting of the climate. Although there was a tendency for runoff to decrease in basins where vegetation density increased, the relation between precipitation and runoff was much stronger. Overall, we found weak evidence for vegetation density changes, driven by hydroclimate, to act as NBS on the landscape scale over the studied regions. However, as hydroclimatic changes interact with vegetation changes and their ensuing hydrological responses in complex ways, more detailed investigations are needed to determine the potential NBS effect on the landscape scale across Nordic and Arctic regions. © 2018 The Authors Land Degradation & Development Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd',\n",
       " 'In an increasingly urban world, developing sustainable cities is crucial for global sustainability. Urban nature-based solutions (NBS), such as green infrastructure, are often promoted for their potential to provide several urban services. These include stormwater mitigation, improving energy efficiency of buildings, and carbon emissions mitigation, but few studies have compared the multifunctionality of NBS to conventional urban solutions providing similar services. Fewer yet have acknowledged the indirect resource (specifically climate, land, energy, water [CLEW] nexus) impacts that these solutions may have. This paper analyzes these aspects, employing a simple CLEW nexus accounting framework, and attempts a consistent comparison across different resource systems. The comparison includes direct and indirect impacts of a set of stylized—and diverse—solutions, each with different primary objectives: green roofs, representing a multifunctional urban NBS; permeable pavements targeting mitigation of stormwater flows; window retrofits targeting energy efficiency; and rooftop PV installations targeting CO2 emissions mitigation. The results highlight both the direct and total (CLEW nexus) impacts of green roofs on stormwater retention, energy use, and CO2 emissions. However, also for the studied conventional solutions with primarily a single direct function, CLEW nexus impacts spread across all measured dimensions (energy, water, and CO2) to varying degrees. Although the numerical results are indicative and uncertainty needs to be further assessed, we suggest that the development of this type of multifunctional, multisystem assessment can assist urban sustainability planning, with comprehensive and consistent comparison of diverse (NBS and conventional) solutions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",
       " 'Green roofs are becoming a major nature-based solution worldwide to reduce urban stormwater runoff. Runoff reduction and retention mainly depend on the hydrological characteristics of substrates and the water use strategies of plants. However, little is known about how plant species affect the hydrological performance of green roofs. Two commonly used succulent plants and four turfgrass species were investigated for their impacts on the hydrological performance and runoff reduction of green roof lysimeters under controlled conditions using a rainfall simulator. The results showed that two succulent plants (Sedum lineare and Callisia repens) did not make significant contributions to canopy interception in any of the four seasons and made only minor contributions to evapotranspiration (ET) water loss in autumn and winter, resulting in minor effects on runoff reduction by the green roofs. Festuca arundinacea contributed 47.4–116.7% of water loss via transpiration and 36.5% of runoff reduction under a 25\\xa0mm\\xa0day−1 rainfall intensity in spring and 48.0% of runoff reduction under a 10\\xa0mm\\xa0day−1 rainfall intensity in winter. Poa pratensis, Lolium perenne, and Agrostis stolonifera also significantly reduced runoff. Runoff reductions by extensive green roofs were mainly caused by ET rather than by their canopy interceptions. Plant shoot biomass and ET were the primary factors controlling the runoff reduction by extensive green roofs. Our results strongly suggest that the runoff reduction capacity of extensive green roofs can be greatly improved by selecting plant species with a higher shoot biomass and ET rate. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",
       " 'It is well-known that the disposal of municipal solid waste in landfills has adverse effects on the environment and human health. Restoration of closed landfills is essential to compensate for disturbances in the ecosystem, minimize negative impact on the environment, and ensure safety in further use. It was hypothesized that specific plant succession knowledge can present nature-based solutions to restore and rehabilitate degraded ecosystems at municipal solid waste landfills. The goal of the 8-year study was to identify restoration strategies based on vegetation succession. For the vegetation survey, we recorded the vegetation over the period 2007–2015. The study was carried out on the surface of the landfill site. We also used four mathematical models to analyze the increase of plant species over time. During the study period, 195 vascular plant species were recorded. There was a progressive change in plant communities and an increase in biodiversity. What is more, the growth prediction models show that the diversity of plant species over time at the landfill site has an increasing tendency, which has beneficial implications for landfill restoration. During the vegetation survey period, there was no evidence to suggest that the landfill site had a significant impact on the biotic composition of the environment. We can conclude that the health status of plants occurring in the landfill was good. Plants both contributed to and indicated the health of the landfill site and were found to be a convenient and natural component of landfill restoration. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",
       " 'Considering the potential of wetlands to dampen temporal variability of water flow through the landscape, they are increasingly considered as possible nature-based solutions to mitigate risks of flooding and drought. In this study, we investigate flow variability by means of a flow dampening factor and use observation data from 1984 to 2013 for 82 Swedish catchments to statistically and comparatively analyze the large-scale effects on this factor of multiple wetlands and lakes in the landscape. The results show good correlation between large-scale flow dampening and relative area of lakes and floodplain wetlands within a catchment. An increase in relative area up to around 15% for lakes and 0.5% for floodplain wetlands lowers the temporal standard deviation of runoff (R) to around 10%–15% of that for precipitation (P), compared with a common flow-variability dampening of around 35% for catchments with lake-wetland area close to zero. Further increase in these relative areas, or in those of wetland types other than floodplain wetlands, has little or no flow dampening effect. The results indicate that the large-scale flow dampening effect of lakes and floodplain wetlands is mainly due to their water-storage capacity and less due to their possible effects on the partitioning of P between R and evapotranspiration. Overall, the results emphasize the importance of accounting for the problem scale and relative water-storage capacity of wetlands when considering their large-scale efficiency as possible nature-based solutions for large-scale flow-variability regulation in whole catchments. © 2018 The Authors Land Degradation & Development Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.',\n",
       " \"Numerous cities in the world have to handle and support increasing populations, with questions remaining concerning good planning strategies for their growth and development. Among these questions, access to nature for urban residents has been the subject of increased scrutiny in recent years. We here propose and apply a generally applicable new approach to quantitatively investigate the role of close access to natural or nature-based green–blue areas for the well-being of urban populations. A key novel aspect of this approach is to use income level as a measure of people's ability to choose their nearby living environment such that it provides them with the highest affordable level of well-being. Based on this measure, we concretely investigate possible trends in local green–blue area access with increasing local income level in the case-study example of the Stockholm Metropolitan region in Sweden. For this regional case, we find clear relationships between income level (and related degree of nationality homogeneity) and share of natural/nature-based green–blue areas and man-made grey areas within walksheds of different population segments. The results point at the importance of maintaining and restoring nearby natural and nature-based green–blue areas as key solutions for increased well-being of urban populations and call for further testing and comparative investigations of local-scale associations between socio-economic descriptors and physical environment in other parts of the world. © 2018 The Authors Land Degradation & Development Published by John Wiley & Sons Lt.\",\n",
       " 'Air pollution is an environmental and social issue at different spatial scales, especially in a climate change context, with an expected decrease of air quality. Despite the technological evolution of the last decades in the transport sector, road traffic emissions are still one major source of air pollution at the city level. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of a set of resilience measures, based on nature-based solutions, in the wind flow and in the dispersion of air pollutants, in a built-up area in Portugal. For that, two pollutants were analysed (NOX and PM10) and four scenarios were developed: i) a baseline scenario, ii) an urban green scenario, iii) a green roof scenario, and iv) a “grey” scenario (without trees). Two models were used, namely the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) and the CFD model VADIS (pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere under variable wind conditions). The WRF model was used to initialize the CFD model, while the last was one used to perform the set of numerical simulations, on hourly basis. The implementation of a green urban area promoted a reduction of air pollutants concentrations, of about 16% [PM10] and 19% [NOx] in the overall domain; while the application of green roofs showed an increase of concentrations (reaching 60% during specific time periods). Overall the results showed that a strategic placement of vegetation in cities has the potential to make an important contribution to the improvement of air quality and sustainability of urban environments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions provide a variety of benefits in growing cities, ranging from stormwater treatment to amenity provision such as aesthetics. However, the decision-making process involved in the installation of such green infrastructure is not straightforward, as much uncertainty around the location, size, costs and benefits impedes systematic decision-making. We developed a model to simulate decision rules used by local municipalities to install nature-based stormwater treatment systems, namely constructed wetlands, ponds/basins and raingardens. The model was used to test twenty-four scenarios of policy-making, by combining four asset selection, two location selection and three budget constraint decision rules. Based on the case study of a local municipality in Metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, the modelled uptake of stormwater treatment systems was compared with attributes of real-world systems for the simulation period. Results show that the actual budgeted funding is not reliable to predict systems’ uptake and that policy-makers are more likely to plan expenditures based on installation costs. The model was able to replicate the cumulative treatment capacity and the location of systems. As such, it offers a novel approach to investigate the impact of using different decision rules to provide environmental services considering biophysical and economic factors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"The regulating function is the least understood but probably most valuable service provided by an ecosystem. To estimate the impact of externalities on the regulating function of a wetland, we modelled the interdependence between activities that affect wetland characteristics and land utilization patterns. Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide benefits for society, the economy and nature. The NBS solution for wetland bioremediation is proposed through a combination of ecosystem value provided by nature-based or artificial arable land. We constructed a model to simulate the dynamic spatial and temporal changes in the regulating function of a wetland to study the impact of agricultural and fishing activities on the functions and services of a wetland ecosystem. The model was used to determine the relationship between land use change, wetland range, water quality, and fish stocks. Huangqihai Lake (HQHL) is a relatively isolated lake in an area interlaced with agriculture and pasture zones. From 1973 to 2014, the “shrinkage” of the water area of HQHL approached 60%. Under the influence of humans and natural disturbances, the HQHL wetland faced enormous ecological risks, water pollution, area reduction, sharp biodiversity reduction, and fish extinction. The phosphorus (P) concentration seems to be a key factor affecting both the reed growth in the nearshore areas of the Huangqihai Lake wetland and the breeding of phytoplankton in the core lake water area. Dividing this value by the 25,821 ha of the core wetland area affected by the reclamation, the cost per unit of lost fish production is USD$166/ha/yr. After deducting the externalities of the fishery, the net sustainable income from the conversion is USD$1717/ha. The spatial distribution of nutrient load externalities varies with the use of wetlands. In terms of fishery value, the additional nutrient load associated with the conversion of wetland uses would result in a reduction of at least 8% of the maximum sustainable yield. The conversion of wetland uses resulted in the loss of nutrient buffering functions. To compensate for the farmland's nutrient load buffer service, the government should provide arable land farmers USD$8.1 M/yr. It is theoretically feasible to implement an ecosystem service payment system that can effectively compensate for the loss of nutrient buffer function caused by the conversion of wetlands. The approach based on BNS we described may also have value in other ecosystems where regulatory functions include similar mechanisms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " 'Many cities are becoming increasingly dense, bringing more impervious surface and less vegetation-growing space. Dense urban environments demand ecosystem services of urban trees, yet growth conditions are difficult. Innovative planning and management could permit coexistence of urban fabric and nature. This study reviews three groups of constraints to urban forestry in dense areas: (1) spatialsubaerial, (2) subterranean-root, and (3) institutional and social. Integrated proposals are developed to overcome the constraints and optimize the provision and benefits of urban forests despite the stresses. They are based on a typology of compact-city types and tripartite classification of urban land covers. Embracing the landscape-ecological and institutional-social dimensions, they refer to both primary and secondary compact cities. The quality and coverage of urban forests could be improved by pragmatic, actionable and tailor-made solutions. Precision green-space planning for in situ and ex situ densification could tackle the multiple and intractable limitations and prepare redevelopment and new development areas for greenery preservation and installation. Urban forestry could better integrate urban form and density with comprehensive spatial, temporal, and institutional visions. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.',\n",
       " 'Vegetated foreshores adjacent to engineered structures (so-called hybrid flood defenses), are considered to have high potential in reducing flood risk, even in the face of sea level rise and increasing storminess. However, foreshores such as salt marshes and mangrove forests are generally characterized by relatively strong temporal and spatial variations in geometry and vegetation characteristics (e.g., stem height and density), which causes uncertainties with regards to their protective value under extreme storm conditions. Currently, no method is available to assess the failure probability of a hybrid flood defense, taking into account the aforementioned uncertainties. This paper presents a method to determine the failure probability of a hybrid flood defense, integrating models and stochastic parameters that describe dike failure and wave propagation over a vegetated foreshore. Two dike failure mechanisms are considered: failure due to (i) wave overtopping and (ii) wave impact on revetments. Results show that vegetated foreshores cause a reduction in failure probability for both mechanisms. This effect is more pronounced for wave impact on revetments than for wave overtopping, since revetment failure occurs at relatively low water levels. The relevance of different uncertainties depends on the protection level and associated dike height and strength. For relatively low dikes (i.e., low protection levels), vegetation remains stable in design conditions, and plays an important role in reducing wave loads. In case of higher protection levels, hence for more robust dikes, vegetation is less important than foreshore geometry, because of expected stem breakage of the vegetation under these more extreme conditions. The integrated analysis of uncertainties in hydraulic loads, dike geometry and foreshore characteristics in this paper enables the comparison between nature-based flood defenses and traditionally engineered solutions, and allows coastal engineers to design hybrid flood defenses worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " 'Nature-based solutions are rapidly gaining interest in the face of global change and increasing flood risks. While assessments of flood risk mitigation by coastal ecosystems are mainly restricted to local scales, our study assesses the contribution of salt marshes and mangroves to nature-based storm surge mitigation in 11 large deltas around the world. We present a relatively simple GIS model that, based on globally available input data, provides an estimation of the tidal wetland’s capacity of risk mitigation at a regional scale. It shows the high potential of nature-based solutions, as tidal wetlands, to provide storm surge mitigation to more than 80% of the flood-exposed land area for 4 of the 11 deltas and to more than 70% of the flood-exposed population for 3 deltas. The magnitude of the nature-based mitigation, estimated as the length of the storm surge pathway crossing through tidal wetlands, was found to be significantly correlated to the total wetland area within a delta. This highlights the importance of conserving extensive continuous tidal wetlands as a nature-based approach to mitigate flood risks. Our analysis further reveals that deltas with limited historical wetland reclamation and therefore large remaining wetlands, such as the Mississippi, the Niger, and part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra deltas, benefit from investing in the conservation of their vast wetlands, while deltas with extensive historical wetland reclamation, such as the Yangtze and Rhine deltas, may improve the sustainability of flood protection programs by combining existing hard engineering with new nature-based solutions through restoration of former wetlands. © 2018, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.',\n",

This study assesses the extent to which ES were considered by key policy actors involved in the strategic decision-making process leading to an innovative large-scale Dutch coastal management project. We analysed retrospective interviews to ascertain which ES were considered and how they were described by policy actors. Over half of the quotes (118/228) and 16 out of the 17 interviewees referred to three broad ES categories, with high degrees of adoption: coastal safety, recreation and cognitive development (learning by doing). The broad terms ‘nature’ and ‘spatial quality’ were also referenced often (36 times). Our findings suggest that broad, unspecified ecosystem services were adopted highly by the policy actors, while specific ecosystem service categories were rarely considered. Relatable and comprehensible cultural ecosystem services also constituted critical arguments for policy actors in their strategic decision making. We reflect that ambiguous, broad terms can help to garner support and unite efforts across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. For ES to align with relevant aspects of decision making, a ‘translation step’ between ES research and decision making might be required and ambiguity should be acknowledged. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

The analysis shows a clearly positive energy and environmental contribution of green roofs. Although such an investment does not seem to be cost-effective in residential buildings, sensitivity analysis demonstrates that green roofs become financially favorable compared to flat roof constructions with only modest reductions in their current installation cost. Moreover, green roofs offer environmental benefits that are currently difficult to monetize, which can clearly improve urban resilience to climate change. In order to quantify the impact of green roof installations on the surrounding environment, the analysis was expanded from the individual building perspective to neighborhood scale implementation, using appropriate simulation software to evaluate the contribution of green roofs to urban heat island mitigation. Focusing on the ambient air temperature at the pedestrian level, a noticeable decrease was estimated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " \"Surface water flooding is currently viewed as the most serious water-related issue in many of the China's large cities due to rapid urbanization, land-use change and the process of rapid socio-economic development. In 2014, the People's Republic of China established the concept of the ‘Sponge City’ which will be used to tackle urban surface-water flooding and related urban water management issues, such as purification of urban runoff, attenuation of peak run-off and water conservation. The concept is being developed to make use of ‘blue’ and ‘green’ spaces in the urban environment for stormwater management and control. It is envisaged that related practices will enhance natural ecosystems and provide more aesthetically pleasing space for the people that live and work in urban environments, in addition enabling nature-based solutions to improve urban habitats for birds and other organisms. Until recently, grey infrastructure and hard engineering-based management approaches have been adopted in the rapidly developing Chinese urban environment as urban flood and drainage issues are predominantly managed by municipal water engineers. The Sponge City concept and related guidelines and practices will provide multiple opportunities to integrate ideas from eco-hydrology, climate change impact assessment and planning, and consideration of long-term social and environmental well-being, within the urban land-use planning process. This paper aims to explicate the Sponge city concept and its development, and consider the implications of the transformation of urban land-use planning and urban-water management practice in China. To achieve the dual goals of sustainable water-use and better flood control (as targeted by the Sponge City concept), more effective development and implementation of land-use guidance and assessment tools (with explicit integration of urban flood-risk assessment, land-drainage guidance, climate projection methods, and assessment of long-term sustainability) are recommended. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " \"Urbanization process is rapidly converting forested areas and grasslands to residential, commercial, or industrial spaces, triggering soil degradation and significantly increasing impervious surfaces. Consequently, man-made environments experience significant decrease of infiltration and groundwater recharge, enhancing the problems related to the management and protection from increased stormwater runoff. Green roofs are structural measures able to mitigate these negative drawbacks due to anthropic transformation, retaining and detaining stormwater runoff, with the main advantage of reducing hydraulic loads on combined storm sewer systems. Hydrological performance of green roofs have been studied in different parts of the world under different climatic conditions, but a comprehensive study that provides global responses, even in an approximate way, is still missing. The aim of this work is to assess the convenience and the feasibility of installing green roofs in any target area of the world, providing a rough indication of geographic regions where green roof installation is possible with good hydrological performance, and feasible in rainfed conditions with low vegetation water stress. To do that, we explored in silico green roofs' hydrological performance worldwide, using climatological forcings from ERA-Interim database as input for a simple conceptual hydrological model to estimate green roof outputs, in terms of evapotranspiration and runoff.

       " 'Nature-based solutions, such as living shorelines, have the potential to restore critical ecosystems, enhance coastal sustainability, and increase resilience to natural disasters; however, their efficacy during storm events compared to traditional hardened shorelines is largely untested. This is a major impediment to their implementation and promotion to policy-makers and homeowners. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated rock sill living shorelines as compared to natural marshes and hardened shorelines (i.e., bulkheads) in North Carolina, USA for changes in surface elevation, Spartina alterniflora stem density, and structural damage from 2015 to 2017, including before and after Hurricane Matthew (2016). Our results show that living shorelines exhibited better resistance to landward erosion during Hurricane Matthew than bulkheads and natural marshes. Additionally, living shorelines were more resilient than hardened shorelines, as they maintained landward elevation over the two-year study period without requiring any repair. Finally, rock sill living shorelines were able to enhance S.\\xa0alterniflora stem densities over time when compared to natural marshes. Our results suggest that living shorelines have the potential to improve coastal resilience while supporting important coastal ecosystems. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America',\n",

It is mainly focused on solutions using living organisms (in particular plants and microorganisms) to perform functions such as those of soil- and water-bioengineering interventions in order to ensure the safety of human infrastructures and constructions in contexts of conflict between natural processes and human needs. Further, it handles the problematic of reintroducing natural processes and functions in the built environment (urban, industrial, infrastructures, etc.) in order to recover, recreate, or reinvent nature in humanized landscapes and developing a more creative relation between humans and natural elements, processes, and functions. It presents, furthermore, the contribution of natural solutions to a wide variety of decontamination processes and prevention and recovery of degraded land and natural resources. Finally, we discuss the way these solutions can be implemented and the cultural, organizational, administrative and governance, paradigmatic, and practice changes it implies.

In this study, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and pak choi (Brassica chinensis) culture was tested using two techniques: 1) Root floating (RAFT), and 2) Dynamic root floating (DRFT). Water quality parameters, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and phosphate were measured. At the end of the experiment, fish and plants were weighed and the required electric power consumption was calculated. There was no significant difference observed between the effect of each treatment group on either tilapia or pak choi production. Tilapia productivity was 1.69 ± 0.22 kg/m3 and 1.71 ± 0.23 kg/m3 and pak choi yield was 7.43 ± 1.23kg/m2 and 7.32 ± 0.76 kg/m2 for the RAFT and DRFT, respectively. Water quality parameters were within the recommended range for the tilapia culture while pH and conductivity were out of range for the pak choi culture; nevertheless, plant production was good. Total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen did not reach concentrations that could impede tilapia growth. The DRFT allows the elimination of active aeration in hydroponic systems for tilapia and pak choi production during most of the cycle, reducing the electric power consumption to 10.3% and electricity costs to 11.4% by using a nature-based solution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Increasing global urbanization yields substantial potential for enhanced sustainability through careful management of urban development and optimized resource use efficiency. Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide a means for cities to successfully navigate the water-energy-climate relationship, thus enhancing urban resilience. Implementation of NBS can improve local or regional economic resilience underpinned by the sustainable use of natural resources. The innovative governance, institutional, business, and finance models and frameworks inherent to NBS implementation also provide a wealth of opportunity for social transformation and increased social inclusiveness in cities. The ultimate benefit of NBS implementation in cities is increased livability, which is typically measured as a function of multiple social, economic and environmental variables. Given the range of different interventions classified as NBS and the cross-sectoral character of their co-benefits, different assessment schemes can be used to evaluate NBS performance and impact. Herein, performance and impact indicators within three robust NBS- and Smart City-related assessment schemes-Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES), Knowledge and Learning Mechanism on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (EKLIPSE), and Smart City Performance Measurement Framework (CITYkeys)-were critically analyzed with respect to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, \"Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\" Each selected assessment scheme was benchmarked with respect to the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators\\' global indicator framework for the sub-objectives of SDG 11. The alignment between each of the selected NBS assessment schemes and the SDG indicator framework was mapped with particular emphasis on consistency with city-level framework indicators for each SDG 11 sub-objective. The results were illustrated as composite scores describing the alignment of the analyzed NBS and Smart city assessment schemes with the SDG 11 sub-objectives. These results facilitate NBS assessment scheme selection based on alignment between each analyzed assessment scheme and specific SDG 11 sub-objectives. Cities face multiple challenges amidst a complex hierarchy of legislative, regulatory and other stakeholder obligations. The present study showed that strategic selection of an NBS assessment scheme which closely aligns with one or more sub-objectives within SDG 11 can maximize operational efficiency by exploiting synergies between evaluation schemes. © 2018 Wendling, Huovila, zu Castell-Rüdenhausen, Hukkalainen and Airaksinen.',\n",
       " 'As the reality of a carbon-neutral market and future takes form, all available resources will need to be focused upon removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this regard, no alternative is more promising today than nature-based solutions. Restoration of native ecosystems and the use of management concepts such as adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing for ranchland have the potential to reliably store vast amounts of carbon in near-surface soil at very low cost. If only half of the existing US grazing lands is managed differently than now, these healthy soils could store from 10 to 23 percent of US carbon dioxide emissions every year. Moreover, healthy soils will significantly enhance the economic profitability and drought and flood resilience of ranches. To date, no trading system meets the needs and requirements of the private landowners that control the land that has the ability to sequester these immense amounts of carbon dioxide. The Soil Value Exchange (SVX) is designed to support landowners as they manage their property to promote healthy soils and soil carbon storage by (1) implementing a soil-carbon trading system based on robust soil carbon measurements that works for land owners and carbon credit buyers, (2) providing grants for land management consultant support, and (3) providing grants to support soil carbon measurements. SVX has established collaborations with expert land consultancy organizations and has a goal of enabling the storage of 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year in 2024 and 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide credits each year in 2028. © 2018 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.',\n",

       " 'Green infrastructure and in particular green roofs are crucial to meet the challenge of sustainable urbanisation fostered by the current European Research and Innovation agenda. Several documents were issued in the last decades in Europe for regulating the design, construction and up-keep of roof greening. In particular, the actual German guidelines have been widely adopted as a reference basis for green roof design and regulation worldwide, because of its exhaustiveness and proven building- and landscaping tradition. With the aim to assess the effectiveness of green roof guidelines and norms in supporting plant and soil biodiversity in different ecoregions, and particularly of the Mediterranean one, the German guidelines, the Swiss and Italian norms are screened and discussed in this paper. The German guidelines were chosen for their traditional referential role, the Swiss norm for its peculiar biodiversity approach, the Italian one for its application on a territory with remarkably heterogeneous environmental conditions, stretching from Alpine to Mediterranean ecosystems. Even if the three documents at comparison addressed to some extent biodiversity-related matters, none of them deepened the relationship between plant species selection (local ecotypes), growing medium composition (materials, granular size and thickness) and system build-ups (multi-layers and/or single-layer systems). This is a crucial point for countries, like Italy, encompassing very different climatic conditions. It was concluded that at the current knowledge a guideline/norm taking into account the peculiarities of green roof design in the Mediterranean ecoregion has to be widely refined. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

The results indicated that forest areas decreased by 14.9% and irrigated crops, dry land farming areas, range lands and residential areas increased by 46.8%, 31.1%, 4.7% and 17.5%, respectively. To calibrate and validate the studied period, the Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were applied, ranging from 0.57 to 0.75 and from 0.62 to 0.76 for flow simulation and 0.84 and 0.63 and 0.75 and 0.83 for nitrate simulation, respectively. The results of land use scenarios indicated that respective water flow and nitrate loads increased by 34.4% and 42.2% in 1991-2013 and may even increase by 42.3% and 55.9% in the simulated period of 2013-2050 in all sub-basins. It is likely that the main reason for these results was due to the increase in agricultural activities and the decrease in forestry areas.

       " 'Noise pollution has been recognized as one of major threats to the health of urban residents. Increasing green space availability can create a natural buffer to the adverse effects of living in an urban environment. These positive effects of urban green space can be directly related to an objective reduction of noise levels and – indirectly – to the subjective perception of noise exposure. In our study carried out in Lodz, Poland, we explored the relationship between objective noise levels and the subjective perception of noise exposure by urban residents in relation to urban green space availability. We refer to objective noise exposure expressed as GIS modelled Lden derived from noise maps (compliant with the Environmental Noise Directive, 2002/49/EC), and subjective (self-reported) perception of noise exposure as declared in a questionnaire-based survey. We compared the percentage of green space in a buffer, the objectively measured noise level, and the perceived exposure to noise to find the most appropriate radius of the green space buffer. We decided to choose the green space coverage which is not correlated with an objective noise level to avoid potential multicollinearity in regression models. This contrasts with most studies, in which the radius of the buffer is set a priori. We thus compared the selected buffer of green space coverage – 300 m (representing green space availability) – with perceived noise exposure. We used the spatial error probit model to differentiate the impacts of objective and subjective noise indicators, at the same time including also the factor of green space availability. We found out that the direct effect of objectively measured noise levels, education, the presence of noisy neighbours, and building characteristics were the most important variables influencing the self-reported perception of noise by urban residents. The indirect effect of green space availability on noise perception was not strong, yet statistically significant. Although our study does not provide clear-cut evidence, it indicates that the indirect, psychological effects of urban green spaces can positively affect the life satisfaction of urban residents. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH',\n",

Entrapping microsites, although mainly used for restoring eroded terrestrial resources, were first tested for restoring an eroded mangrove dominated muddy coast of Vam Ray, Hon Dat, Kien Giang, Vietnam. Entrapping microsites, constructed with a 50 cm layer of discarded Melaleuca small sticks that were overlain on the surface of the site, accumulated a high level of fine grained sediment and promoted robust natural regeneration or regrowth of local mangrove species after approximately two years.

       " 'The development of efficient bioremediation techniques to reduce aquatic pollutant load in natural sediment is one of the current challenges in ecological engineering. A nature-based solution for metal bioremediation is proposed through a combination of bioturbation and phytoremediation processes in experimental indoor microcosms. The invertebrates Tubifex tubifex (Oligochaeta Tubificidae) was used as an active ecological engineer for bioturbation enhancement. The riparian plant species Typha latifolia was selected for its efficiency in phyto-accumulating pollutants from sediment. Phytoremediation efficiency was estimated by using cadmium as a conservative pollutant known to bio-accumulate in plants, and initially introduced in the overlying water (20 μg Cd/L of cadmium nitrate – Cd(NO3)2·4H2O). Biological sediment reworking by invertebrates’ activity was quantified using luminophores (inert particulates). Our results showed that bioturbation caused by tubificid worms’ activity followed the bio-conveying transport model with a downward vertical velocity (V) of luminophores ranging from 16.7 ± 4.5 to 18.5 ± 3.9 cm·year− 1. The biotransport changed the granulometric properties of the surface sediments, and this natural process was still efficient under cadmium contamination. The highest value of Cd enrichment coefficient for plant roots was observed in subsurface sediment layer (below 1 cm to 5 cm depth) with tubificids addition. We demonstrated that biotransport changed the distribution of cadmium across the sediment column as well as it enhanced the pumping of this metal from the surface to the anoxic sediment layers, thereby increasing the bioaccumulation of cadmium in the root system of Typha latifolia. This therefore highlights the potential of bioturbation as a tool to be considered in future as integrated bioremediation strategies of metallic polluted sediment in aquatic ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.',\n",
       " \"Increasing climate change impacts are a major threat to sustainable urban development, and challenge current governance structures, including actors' responsibilities for dealing with climate variability and extremes. The need for distributed risk governance and citizen engagement is increasingly recognised; however, few empirical studies systematically assess interactions between citizens and municipalities in climate risk management and adaptation. Here, we develop an explorative framework, applied to three Swedish municipalities, to map existing ‘adaptation interactions’ and analyse how responsibilities for climate adaptation manifest and are (re)negotiated. The results show that adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, despite positive adaptation outcomes from related local processes. Structures and mechanisms for systematic monitoring and learning are also lacking. We argue that fostering collaborations with citizens – to support long-term adaptation and reduce the adaptation burden of those most at risk – requires consideration of four strategic issues: proactive engagement; equity and ‘responsibilisation’; nature-based approaches; and systematic adaptation mainstreaming. Finally, we discuss how our analytical framework can contribute to further theorising municipalities' engagement with citizens on climate risk. © 2017 The Authors.

       " 'Despite the efforts to control, protect and improve freshwater resources, eutrophication is still one of the main causes for reservoir water quality deterioration. Low-quality raw water reaching water supply treatment plants (WTP) implies an increment of chemical reagents to meet safety requirements, which may also increase the potential of disinfection by-products formation. The objective of this paper was to study the relationship between raw water quality coming from a water supply reservoir and the use of reagents in the associated WTP, through a series of stepwise regression models, in order to develop a simple statistical tool to select the most adequate withdrawal depth for optimizing the treatment processes. The results showed that chlorides, ammonia and water color were the main subrogate parameters in the reservoir explaining the need of chlorine and ozone in the pre-treatment and alum sulphate consumption in the WTP. Therefore, by controlling the variation of these parameters in the water column it would be possible to select the most appropriate reservoir withdrawal depth for reducing costs and risk of by-products formation during treatment, making the most of the water purification service offered by the ecosystem. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.',\n",

Against this background, this paper aims to increase the knowledge of current advances and possible ways to support the implementation of the ecosystem services (ES) approach at the municipal level. More specifically, we analyze how ES have been integrated into comprehensive planning within the municipality of Malmö in Sweden over the last 60 years, a declared forerunner in local environmental governance. Based on a content analysis of comprehensive plans over the period 1956–2014 and interviews with municipal stakeholders, this paper demonstrates how planning has shifted over time toward a more holistic view of ES and their significance for human well-being and urban sustainability. Both explicit and implicit applications of the ES concept were found in the analyzed comprehensive plans and associated programs and projects. Our study shows how these applications reflect international, national, and local policy changes, and indicates how municipalities can gradually integrate the ES approach into comprehensive planning and facilitate the transition from implicit to more explicit knowledge use. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

Here we focus on the city's internationally-acclaimed urban forest strategy (UFS), investigating how and to which extent the governance arrangements embedded within the UFS draw strength from diverse perspectives and allow for institutional arrangements that support “situated” reflexive decision making and co-creation. We find that Melbourne's UFS governance process fosters green placemaking by re-focusing climate adaptation solutions from technological strategies to situated socio-ecological principles such as human well-being and community-based decision making.

Yet, underlying factors enabling ES values are still poorly understood. We assume the production of ES value crucial for environmental stewardship in cities, and aimed in this study to uncover their key enabling factors. This study has been developed on a broad data base including a survey (n = 201), interviews (n = 46), field observation and remote sensing from 27 urban gardens in Barcelona, Spain, including municipal ‘allotment gardens’ and ‘civic gardens’ emerging from bottom-up initiatives. In a first step, we distinguished different urban gardens types regarding the ES values they provide. In a second step, we tested specific garden characteristics including (a) user profiles, (b) biophysical garden properties, and (c) institutional settings for their specific importance to trigger ES values. Results showed ES values to significantly differ with the types of gardens. For example, classical allotment gardens are more likely to provide recreational values, while emerging civic gardens are more likely to produce place-making and social cohesion. A main finding from our study is the importance of social and institutional garden characteristic as enabling factors of ES values. Results indicate, for example, a correlation between childhood experiences and a higher appreciation of ES. Our results further indicate that civic gardens with broader property rights and decision-capacities are more likely to enhance stewardship action. In providing a differentiated understanding of the ES value(s) of urban gardens, this study highlights the potential for green space planning in cities to steer the stewardship of urban gardens by providing institutional and physical space for civic gardening initiatives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

To make ecosystem services (ES) trade-off research more relevant for spatial planning, we propose an analytical framework, which puts stakeholders, their land-use/management choices, their impact on ES and responses at the centre. Based on 24 cases from around the world, we used this framing to analyse the appearance and diversity of real-world ES trade-offs. They cover a wide range of trade-offs related to ecosystem use, including: land-use change, management regimes, technical versus nature-based solutions, natural resource use, and management of species. The ES trade-offs studied featured a complexity that was far greater than what is often described in the ES literature. Influential users and context setters are at the core of the trade-off decision-making, but most of the impact is felt by non-influential users. Provisioning and cultural ES were the most targeted in the studied trade-offs, but regulating ES were the most impacted. Stakeholders’ characteristics, such as influence, impact faced, and concerns can partially explain their position and response in relation to trade-offs. Based on the research findings, we formulate recommendations for spatial planning. © 2017',\n",

       " 'An ecosystem services-based approach can constitute the analytical basis to develop a multipurpose framework able to identify and assess the multi-benefits generated by nature-based solutions (NBS). An ecosystem services analytical framework goes beyond individual sustainability-related issues and beyond the traditional mono-sectoral view, such as: water and waste management, urban regeneration, transport, energy efficiency in buildings, resilience and climate change in a separate way. All these issues have in fact ecosystem services as a common denominator, but it is not currently possible to synoptically consider the results across different sectoral themes. This paper shows how an ecosystem services framework can link all these sectoral issues and how an accounting frame for ecosystem services can be built. First an ecosystem services classification specifically for the NBS at the local scale for the urban contexts is tailored. Second, an attempt is made to build ecosystem services accounts within the official accounting frames currently developed. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to show how the whole accounting frame work to assess resilience, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and risk management based on the presence (absence) of NBS.

The recent landslides have not only natural causes, but they are also due to factors related to the location of population settlements and their behavior. The demand for land in hilly areas has led to the use of marginal land, prone to landslides in unstable slopes. Control of landslides in upland areas requires an integrated approach and the issues in these areas need to be addressed in a comprehensive way by enforcing new policies and land management regulations, planning landslide risk reduction activities, improving early warning systems, improving community level landslide preparedness, developing monitoring and evaluation systems for monitoring the vulnerable slopes, and formulating necessary policies. In many areas, the risk-informed nature-based solutions and hybrid solutions can be effective in reducing the impacts of landslides.

Apart from investigating the presence of seagrass from the environmental point of view, there is also a need to assess its impact on the coastal hydrodynamics. The impact on the wave heights of a seagrass meadow located on the Southern Romanian coast, has been analyzed by means of a wave model. In this purpose, several numerical simulations have been performed, both for low and average offshore wave conditions, available from a previous wave climate study, which used a 30 years climate data set. A first set of simulations have been performed in the absence of seagrass. Then a seagrass meadow has been added to our grid and the wave model has been run in the same offshore wave conditions. The differences in computed nearshore wave heights reach around 4% for moderate energy waves. These results show that, on the Southern Romanian coast, seagrass could be regarded as an additional measure for nearshore wave attenuation. © 2018, National Research and Development Institute for Marine Geology and Geoecology.

Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) may, therefore, produce serious water pollution and flooding problems in downstream RWBs. Methodologies for a rational management of CSOs quantity and quality share many commonalities, and these two aspects should be considered together in order to maximize benefits and promote local distributed actions, especially in high urban density areas where the space availability for the construction of CSO storage tanks is often a limiting factor. In this paper, a novel strategy to control downstream flow propagation of a CSO as well as to improve its quality is tested on a real case study in the area of the metropolitan city of Milan. The approach is based on the combination of grey, green and blue infrastructures and exploits the integrated storage and self-depuration capacities of a firstflush tank, a constructed wetland and a natural stream to obtain admissible flow rates and adequate water quality in the RWB. The results, evaluated through a modelling framework based on simplified equations of water and pollutants dynamics, show excellent performances for the integrated system, both in terms of flow control and pollution mitigation. The pollution, using biological oxygen demand concentration as a proxy of the whole load, was decreased by more than 90% and downstream flooding situations were avoided, despite the spillway was not regulated. Concerning the economic point of view, from a rough estimate of the costs, the system allows reducing the investment of 30 to 50% in respect to the traditional CSO controls based solely on flow detention tanks. The proposed approach, as well as the modelling framework for its effective implementation, appear strongly scalable in different world contexts and aim to fill the gap between urban and rural environments in the management of stormwater and CSOs, promoting the involvement of the water managers, the irrigation-reclamation agencies and regional authorities. © D.

       " 'Rising temperatures, increasing food demand and scarcity of water and land resources highlight the importance of promoting the sustainable expansion of agriculture to our urban environment, while preserving water resources. Treating urban wastewaters, such as greywater and hydroponic wastewater, may represent a strategic point for the implementation of urban farming, ensuring food security, reducing pressures on water resources and promoting climate change mitigation. The WETWALL design concept proposes a unique ecotechnology for secondary wastewater treatment at an urban scale, which brings the novelty of a modular living wall hybrid flow. This concept is based on the integration of two established nature-based solutions/ecomimetic designs: constructed wetlands and a modular living walls. First presented is an overview about the state of the art in the scope of living walls treating wastewater, in order to identify the main design aspects related to the performance of such systems, which mainly concerns the removal of nitrates and phosphates. Second, the WETWALL design concept is presented. A scheme regarding the selection of the main components, such as plants and substrate, is proposed, and potential structure developments and operation strategies are discussed. In addition, considering the scope of integrating the circular economy with the design process, potential interactions between this technology and the urban environment are discussed. The main goal of this article is to substantiate the potential of the WETWALL design concept as an innovative wastewater treatment at an urban scale. © 2018 Desalination Publications.

       " \"The growing human population concentrated in urban areas lead to the increase of road traffic and artificial areas, consequently enhancing air pollution and urban heat island effects, among others. These environmental changes affect citizen's health, causing a high number of premature deaths, with considerable social and economic costs. Nature-based solutions are essential to ameliorate those impacts in urban areas. While the mere presence of urban green spaces is pointed as an overarching solution, the relative importance of specific vegetation structure, composition and management to improve the ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation are overlooked. This avoids the establishment of optimized planning and management procedures for urban green spaces with high spatial resolution and detail. Our aim was to understand the relative contribution of vegetation structure, composition and management for the provision of ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation in urban green spaces, in particular the case of urban parks. This work was done in a large urban park with different types of vegetation surrounded by urban areas. As indicators of microclimatic effects and of air pollution levels we selected different metrics: lichen diversity and pollutants accumulation in lichens. Among lichen diversity, functional traits related to nutrient and water requirements were used as surrogates of the capacity of vegetation to filter air pollution and to regulate climate, and provide air purification and climate regulation ecosystem services, respectively. This was also obtained with very high spatial resolution which allows detailed spatial planning for optimization of ecosystem services. We found that vegetation type characterized by a more complex structure (trees, shrubs and herbaceous layers) and by the absence of management (pruning, irrigation and fertilization) had a higher capacity to provide the ecosystems services of air purification and climate regulation. By contrast, lawns, which have a less complex structure and are highly managed, were associated to a lower capacity to provide these services. Tree plantations showed an intermediate effect between the other two types of vegetation. Thus, vegetation structure, composition and management are important to optimize green spaces capacity to purify air and regulate climate. Taking this into account green spaces can be managed at high spatial resolutions to optimize these ecosystem services in urban areas and contribute to improve human well-being. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.\",\n",
       " 'Urban areas’ population has grown during the last century and it is expected that over 60% of the world population will live in cities by 2050. Urban parks provide several ecosystem services that are valuable to the well-being of city-dwellers and they are also considered a nature-based solution to tackle multiple environmental problems in cities. However, the type and amount of ecosystem services provided will vary with each park vegetation type, even within same the park. Our main goal was to quantify the trade-offs in ecosystem services associated to different vegetation types, using a spatially detailed approach. Rather than relying solely on general vegetation typologies, we took a more ecologically oriented approach, by explicitly considering different units of vegetation structure and composition. This was demonstrated in a large park (44 ha) located in the city of Almada (Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal), where six vegetation units were mapped in detail and six ecosystem services were evaluated: carbon sequestration, seed dispersal, erosion prevention, water purification, air purification and habitat quality. The results showed that, when looking at the park in detail, some ecosystem services varied greatly with vegetation type. Carbon sequestration was positively influenced by tree density, independently of species composition. Seed dispersal potential was higher in lawns, and mixed forest provided the highest amount of habitat quality. Air purification service was slightly higher in mixed forest, but was high in all vegetation types, probably due to low background pollution, and both water purification and erosion prevention were high in all vegetation types. Knowing the type, location, and amount of ecosystem services provided by each vegetation type can help to improve management options based on ecosystem services trade-offs and looking for win-win situations. The trade-offs are, for example, very clear for carbon: tree planting will boost carbon sequestration regardless of species, but may not be enough to increase habitat quality. Moreover, it may also negatively influence seed dispersal service. Informed practitioners can use this ecological knowledge to promote the role of urban parks as a nature-based solution to provide multiple ecosystem services, and ultimately improve the design and management of the green infrastructure. This will also improve the science of Ecosystem Services, acknowledging that the type of vegetation matters for the provision of ecosystem services and trade-offs analysis. © 2017 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Climate change impacts are a key challenge for sustainable urban development. To address this challenge, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), i.e., the use of ecosystem services and biodiversity to help people adapt to climate change, is increasingly being considered as an alternative or complement to traditional, engineering-based approaches (increasingly also known as nature-based solutions). However, little research on ecosystem-based adaptation has been carried out in urban areas, and empirical evidence of its effectiveness and uptake in strategic adaptation planning is particularly lacking. Against this background, this study investigates the implementation of urban EbA in strategic adaptation planning. Based on a comparative analysis of all German municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, it examines the integration of EbA into municipal adaptation strategies. The results show that there is, so far, no comprehensive uptake of the EbA concept. While current strategies differ significantly in their type, structure, scope, maturity and content, overall the EbA concept remains implicit. 76% of the assessed strategies include some kind of ecosystem-based adaptation measures, which focus on enhancing the conservation, restoration, creation or sustainable management of ecosystems, and 25% of all strategies highlight the multiple benefits of these measures. However, comprehensive approaches are missing. We conclude that better policy support and comprehensive mainstreaming of EbA (e.g., through more distributed urban governance, science-policy integration, combined top-down policies and bottom-up activities) is urgently needed to foster sustainable urban development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Cities undergoing climate change and rapid urbanization are faced with significant transformational processes that affect the environment and society, challenging them to become more sustainable and resilient. The promotion of nature-based solutions represents an efficient approach to meet sustainability targets in cities and improve the quality of life of citizens. The association of large components of green infrastructure, such as urban parks, with physical activity can counteract the sedentary lifestyle endemic to cities and improve the overall health and well-being of individuals (Carrus et al., 2013; Scopelliti et al., 2016). By promoting a sustainable means of transport and connecting green spaces within a highly urbanized city, bicycle lanes represent an effective tool for associating physical activity with nature in cities allowing bicycle users to benefit from the positive health effects of nature-based solutions. Our study focuses on the potential of bicycle lanes to improve functional connectivity among green spaces. We administered 820 questionnaires in 34 green spaces (i.e., urban parks) in Bucharest, Romania, to identify the factors influencing the use of bicycle lanes connecting urban parks and to understand which planning criteria for bicycle lanes are considered as the most important by park visitors. We applied binary and ordinal logistic regressions and found that the factors affecting bicycle lane use are illegally parked cars and lack of accessibility to urban parks. The criteria preferred by park visitors for bicycle lane planning are determined by experience level and frequency of bicycle use. To develop a functional and integrated bicycle lane network that can make cities healthier and more sustainable, policy makers are advised to engage in a public participatory process and focus on the needs of bicycle users. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.',\n",
       " \"A high percentage of urban areas are covered by impermeable surfaces which reduce infiltration and landscape retention of stormwater. Moreover, the pollution flushed from these areas, particularly after intensive rainfall, is often drained directly to rivers and reservoirs which, in many cases, also serve a recreational function in cities. Stormwater runoff contributes to degradation of aquatic ecosystems and their intensified eutrophication which, in growing seasons, results in toxic cyanobacterial blooms. The hybrid system (combined of engineering and biological measures) tested in this research was constructed in 2013 in Łódź city (POLNAD) to retain and purify stormwater runoff from a street that runed directly to a cascade of recreational reservoirs. The hybrid system consists of an underground separators system that is combined with a sequential sedimentation-biofiltration system (SSBS). In the first two years of the system's operation, it effectively reduced pollution transported to the urban river system by reducing 86.0% of total suspended solids, 71.5% of total nitrogen (TN), 66.7% of total phosphorous (TP), and from 40.7% to 78.3% of PO43− and NO2−, respectively. In addition, the system was able to reduce the hydraulic stress induced by extreme discharges and mitigated discharges for precipitation amounts less than 9 mm. The hybrid system is an example of a nature-based solution measure reducing the negative effects of nutrients transfer, eutrophication and flooding in urbanized areas, as part of the blue-green infrastructure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",
       " \"Despite their evidently different assumptions and operationalization strategies, the concepts of Circular Economy, Green Economy and Bioeconomy are joined by the common ideal to reconcile economic, environmental and social goals. The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim of this article is thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an ‘umbrella' concept, including elements from Circular Economy and Bioeconomy concepts (e.g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e.g. nature-based solutions. In particular, Circular Economy and Bioeconomy are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e.g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration. The findings are discussed in light of the concepts' synergies and limits, with the purpose to inform research and policy implementation. © 2017 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Urban green and blue spaces promote health by offering areas for physical activity, stress relief, and social interaction, which may be considered as cultural ecosystem services. They also provide a number of regulating ecosystem services that can be regarded as nature-based solutions to mitigate impacts from urbanization-induced challenges. Urban trees and other vegetation provide cooling through shade and evapotranspiration, which reduce the impact of the urban heat island on hot summer days. Urban vegetation may improve air quality by removing air pollutants. Open areas in cities, such as parks, gardens, playgrounds and cemeteries, are unsealed spaces that also improve infiltration during extreme precipitation events providing water regulating functions. All these services have the potential to improve the health of urban residents, particularly of specific vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current state of evidence on the relationship between the health of children and the elderly and urban green and blue spaces that can account as nature-based solutions to urbanization-induced challenges. We discuss potential confounding factors and refer to the different green space metrics used to identify associations to health. From the results, we cannot conclude on a universal protective health effect of urban green and blue spaces for children and the elderly. While the association trend is positive, the results remain inconclusive, context dependent and are partly overridden by socioeconomic confounders. However, the research area is consistently increasing, and we advance important prospects for future research on urban green and blue spaces in the face of global challenges such as urbanization. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.',\n",
       " 'In many countries in the European Union (EU), the popularity of communal urban gardening (CUG) on allotments and community gardens is on the rise. Given the role of this practice in increasing urban resilience, most notably social resilience, municipalities in the Global North are promoting CUG as a nature-based solution (NbS). However, the mechanisms by which institutional actors can best support and facilitate CUG are understudied, which could create a gap between aspiration and reality. The aim of this study is therefore to identify what governance arrangements contribute to CUG delivering social resilience. Through the EU GREEN SURGE project, we studied six CUG initiatives from five EU-countries, representing different planning regimes and traditions. We selected cases taking a locally unique or innovative approach to dealing with urban challenges. A variety of actors associated with each of the cases were interviewed to achieve as complete a picture as possible regarding important governance arrangements. A cross-case comparison revealed a range of success factors, varying from clearly formulated objectives and regulations, municipal support, financial resources and social capital through to the availability of local food champions and facilitators engaging in community building. Municipalities can support CUG initiatives by moving beyond a rigid focus on top-down control, while involved citizens can increase the impact of CUG by pursuing political, in addition to hands-on, activities. We conclude that CUG has clear potential to act as a nature-based solution if managed with sensitivity to local dynamics and context. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.',\n",
       " 'Modern plant breeding tends to focus on maximizing yield, with one of the most ubiquitous implementations being shorter-duration crop varieties. It is indisputable that these breeding efforts have resulted in greater yields in ideal circumstances; however, many farmed locations across Africa suffer from one or more conditions that limit the efficacy of modern short-duration hybrids. In view of global change and increased necessity for intensification, perennial grains and long-duration varieties offer a nature-based solution for improving farm productivity and smallholder livelihoods in suboptimal agricultural areas. Specific conditions where perennial grains should be considered include locations where biophysical and social constraints reduce agricultural system efficiency, and where conditions are optimal for crop growth. Using a time-series of remotely-sensed data, we locate the marginal agricultural lands of Africa, identifying suboptimal temperature and precipitation conditions for the dominant crop, i.e., maize, as well as optimal climate conditions for two perennial grains, pigeonpea and sorghum. We propose that perennial grains offer a lower impact, sustainable nature-based solution to this subset of climatic drivers of marginality. Using spatial analytic methods and satellite-derived climate information, we demonstrate the scalability of perennial pigeonpea and sorghum across Africa. As a nature-based solution, we argue that perennial grains offer smallholder farmers of marginal lands a sustainable solution for enhancing resilience and minimizing risk in confronting global change, while mitigating social and edaphic drivers of low and variable production. © 2017 The Authors',\n",
       " 'To address challenges associated with climate resilience, health and well-being in urban areas, current policy platforms are shifting their focus from ecosystem-based to nature-based solutions (NBS), broadly defined as solutions to societal challenges that are inspired and supported by nature. NBS result in the provision of co-benefits, such as the improvement of place attractiveness, of health and quality of life, and creation of green jobs. Few frameworks exist for acknowledging and assessing the value of such co-benefits of NBS and to guide cross-sectoral project and policy design and implementation. In this paper, we firstly developed a holistic framework for assessing co-benefits (and costs) of NBS across elements of socio-cultural and socio-economic systems, biodiversity, ecosystems and climate. The framework was guided by a review of over 1700 documents from science and practice within and across 10 societal challenges relevant to cities globally. We found that NBS can have environmental, social and economic co-benefits and/or costs both within and across these 10 societal challenges. On that base, we develop and propose a seven-stage process for situating co-benefit assessment within policy and project implementation. The seven stages include: 1) identify problem or opportunity; 2) select and assess NBS and related actions; 3) design NBS implementation processes; 4) implement NBS; 5) frequently engage stakeholders and communicate co-benefits; 6) transfer and upscale NBS; and 7) monitor and evaluate co-benefits across all stages. We conclude that the developed framework together with the seven-stage co-benefit assessment process represent a valuable tool for guiding thinking and identifying the multiple values of NBS implementation. © 2017 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Wetlands are often considered as nature-based solutions that can provide a multitude of services of great social, economic and environmental value to humankind. Changes in land-use, water-use and climate can all impact wetland functions and services. These changes occur at scales extending well beyond the local scale of an individual wetland. However, in practical applications, engineering and management decisions usually focus on individual wetland projects and local site conditions. Here, we systematically investigate if and to what extent research has addressed the large-scale dynamics of landscape systems with multiple wetlands, hereafter referred to as wetlandscapes, which are likely to be relevant for understanding impacts of regional to global change. Although knowledge in many cases is still limited, evidence suggests that the aggregated effects of multiple wetlands in the landscape can differ considerably from the functions observed at individual wetland scales. This applies to provisioning of ecosystem services such as coastal protection, biodiversity support, groundwater level and soil moisture regulation, flood regulation and contaminant retention. We show that parallel and circular flow-paths, through which wetlands are interconnected in the landscape, may largely control such scale-function differences. We suggest ways forward for addressing the mismatch between the scales at which changes take place and the scale at which observations and implementation are currently made. These suggestions can help bridge gaps between researchers and engineers, which is critical for improving wetland function-effect predictability and management. © 2017 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'Like numerous other cities, Beijing and Copenhagen are experiencing more frequent urban flooding due to increased impervious cover and climate change. Consequently, huge investments are foreseen to maintain resilience. Analyses of planning documents and interviews with key stakeholders reveal that in their climate resilience strategies both cities do employ alternative approaches based on on-site retention-detention of stormwater runoff. However, when there is an emergency situation with heavy downpours, both cities rely heavily on conventional concepts involving deep tunnels for rapid discharge. The applied alternative solutions tend to be more engineering-based, like underground tanks in Beijing and detention-discharge plazas in Copenhagen. More nature-based solutions lag behind. Both cities are simultaneously targeting specific additional sustainability goals. Nevertheless, other potential goals seem to be neglected, like livability improvements in Beijing and biodiversity support and water footprint reduction in Copenhagen. The main barriers for implementing more nature-based solutions with greater sustainability potentials were a combination of time constraints caused by external political pressures for rapid problem solving, lack of routines for the innovation and documentation of solutions for dense urban areas, and insufficient multi-sectorial collaboration. These factors limit the propagation of alternative solutions and tip the balance of current investments towards a conventional approach. © IWA Publishing 2017.',\n",
       " \"Freshwater is a key resource and medium for various economic sectors and domestic purposes but its use is often at the expense of natural ecosystems. Water management must change to deal with urgent issues and protect aquatic ecosystems and their services, while addressing the demand for water from the competing claims for cities, agriculture, industry, energy and transport. In this paper key water challenges (shortage, pollution, aquatic ecosystems threatened) have been identified via global modelling. By the IMAGE-GLOBIO model chain a Trend scenario up to 2050 was modelled, as well as the potential of three 'pathways' aimed at halving average global biodiversity loss while also meeting the sustainable development goals. Biodiversity is then used as a guiding principle to address these challenges because water services depend on healthy and biodiverse ecosystems. Subsequently the potential of nature-based solutions is reviewed for four sub-sectors: cities, food production, hydropower, and flood protection, grouped under the three alternative pathways to meet key water challenges. Mainstreaming biodiversity into water policy requires integrated planning. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) could provide an opportune starting point as a well recognised integrating framework for planning, to guide the actual implementation of nature-based solutions in sub-sectors. © IWA Publishing 2017.\",\n",
       " 'A contingent valuation approach is used to estimate how households value different multipurpose infrastructures (conventional or green) for managing flood risk and water pollution. As a case study we consider the Gorla Maggiore water park located in the Lombardy Region, in Northern Italy. The park is a neo-ecosystem including an infrastructure to treat waste water and store excess rain water, built in 2011 on the shore of the Olona River in an area previously used for poplar plantation. This park is the first one of this type built in Italy. A novel aspect of our research is that it not only considers the values people hold for different water ecosystem services (pollution removal, recreative use, wildlife support, flood risk reduction), but also their preferences for how those outcomes are achieved (through conventional or green infrastructures). The results indicate that the type of infrastructure delivering the ecosystem services does have an impact on individuals’ preferences for freshwater ecosystem services. Households are willing to pay from 6.3 to 7.1 euros per year for a green infrastructure (compared to a conventional one), with a premium up to 16.5 euros for a surrounding made of a park. By considering the type of infrastructure within the choice model, we gain a richer understanding of the relationship between social welfare and freshwater ecosystem services. © 2017',\n",
       " 'The aim of this study was to assess the environmental impact of three alternatives for wastewater treatment in small communities. To this end, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out comparing a conventional wastewater treatment plant (i.e. activated sludge system) with two nature-based technologies (i.e. hybrid constructed wetland and high rate algal pond systems). Moreover, an economic evaluation was also addressed. All systems served a population equivalent of 1500 p.e. The functional unit was 1 m3 of water. System boundaries comprised input and output flows of material and energy resources for system construction and operation. The LCA was performed with the software SimaPro® 8, using the ReCiPe midpoint method. The results showed that the nature-based solutions were the most environmentally friendly alternatives, while the conventional wastewater treatment plant presented the worst results due to the high electricity and chemicals consumption. Specifically, the potential environmental impact of the conventional wastewater treatment plant was between 2 and 5 times higher than that generated by the nature-based systems depending on the impact category. Even though constructed wetland and high rate algal pond systems presented similar results in terms of environmental impact, the latter showed to be the less expensive alternative. Nevertheless, the constructed wetland system should be preferred when land occupation is of major concern, since it has a smaller footprint compared to the high rate algal pond alternative. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'The ecosystem services (ES) concept refers to benefits that humanity receives from nature. Investigating how this concept has been embraced within urban planning is important when assessing the awareness of human dependence on natural functions and the potential for the ES concept to increase this awareness. We analyzed planning documents from three small and three large municipalities in southern Sweden to see how explicitly the ES concept was addressed and which individual services were mentioned. We found that five of the municipalities mentioned the ES concept explicitly and the remaining municipality addressed it implicitly. Comprehensive and green plans referred to the ES concept more explicitly than did plans that focused on a single issue. We used 23 individual ES as a reference; each was mentioned in at least one document, but those concerning habitat and recreation were mentioned most frequently. Individual ES were generally described at an elaborate level. No major differences were identified between large and small municipalities except that large ones mentioned more individual ES. Our study demonstrates that municipalities in southern Sweden have started to integrate the ES concept into their planning documents.

       " 'Coal fly ash dumps represent contaminated sites that pollute the environment and affect the health of living organisms. Vegetation development at ash dumps is an ecological solution to minimize the environmental threats of ash; however, low content of nutrients, organic matter and moisture pose a challenge for plant growth at the dumps. Bacterial indole acetic acid (IAA) facilitates plant recruitment and growth, more crucially in degraded ecosystems. Bacteria with different levels of IAA determine the plant-bacterial interactions as pathogenesis or symbiosis, therefore, form microbial functional types. Understanding plant-soil feedback and identifying environmental predictors of bacterial IAA producers at ash dump would help in improving biostimulation strategies for vegetation development. Therefore, to evolve a nature-based solution for vegetational restoration of ash dumps, we analyzed the role of geochemical factors, host species and age of dump on the assembly of rhizobacterial IAA functional types of naturally colonizing grasses (Saccharum ravennae and Cynodon dactylon). Analyses showed that the rhizosphere effect on geochemical traits was distinct in the dumps, irrespective of the host plant and age of the dumps. The rhizobacterial communities from the dumps produce relatively high mean IAA levels and harbor a high micro-diversity of IAA producers as compared with the region as a whole (non-rhizosphere or bulk ash). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the host species and specific nutrients, i.e., NO3-N, PO4-P, Fe, and Na are the significant predictors of bacterial IAA functional types. S. ravennae and C. dactylon provided evidence of driving assembly of different IAA functional types in their rhizosphere via enrichment of NO3-N and PO4-P, respectively. The identification of environmental predictors of rhizobacterial IAA functional types of S. ravennae and C. dactylon has provided basic guidelines to improve the biostimulation strategies to accelerate vegetation restoration at the ash dumps. Both controlled and field experiments involving grass species with supplementation of specific nutrients would be required to develop an effective biostimulation strategy for the on-field application. © 2017 Malhotra, Mishra, Karmakar and Sharma.',\n",

To address this gap, we explored UK local authority manager perceptions of the challenges and opportunities of introducing perennial urban meadows to prioritise biodiversity and aesthetics. This was co-produced as an experiment in urban greenspaces with Luton Parks Service and Bedford Borough Council 2013–15. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the eight stakeholder managers involved to identify key factors impacting on the perceived feasibility of future urban meadow establishment in other areas. All managers identified three dominant factors (aesthetics and public reaction, locational context, and human resources and economic sustainability). Additional factors (local politics, communication, biodiversity and existing habitat and physical factors) varied in importance according to personal values and managerial role. Support for future meadow introduction and a desire to overcome the economic challenge of the disposal of meadow arisings were related to manager biocentricity. Managers were aware of changing public values leading to increasing acceptance of a messier urban aesthetic. They perceived perennial meadows as a realistic alternative to amenity mown grass that in specific contexts could increase local biodiversity and enhance aesthetics if implemented in consultation with the public and local councillors. Our findings have relevance for the wider implementation of such nature-based solutions to urban GI management: Changes in management practice such as the introduction of perennial meadows have significant political, strategic, economic and practical implications and cannot be viewed purely as a technical challenge. © 2017 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Seagrass global distribution has declined in the last decades due to many causes, and the implementation of recovery programmes as well as the development of new restoration techniques are needed. This work describes the development of an innovative restoration measure to enhance Zostera marina (eelgrass) seed germination and seedling survival in sediments inhabited by lugworms (Arenicola marina) and its validation in mesocosm experiments. The technique consists of placing 3 cm thick biodegradable coconut fibre mats (membrane) in the surface sediment to exclude the negative effects of sediment reworking (burial of seeds and destabilization/burial of seedlings). Two different flume mesocosm experiments were setup to test for: i) the effect of membranes on burial of Z. marina seeds; ii) the effect of membranes on survival and growth of Z. marina seedlings. The experiments were run for 8 and 10 weeks, respectively. Results show that the membrane was effectively preventing critical burial of Z. marina seeds as all seed mimics placed on the surface initially were recovered from 0 to 4 cm depth in the plots with membrane, while in the absence of the membrane, all seeds were buried to below the critical depth of 5–6 cm. The membrane also significantly enhanced the survival of Z. marina seedlings. The initial seedling density was in both cases 30/m2 and the final density was 26.0 ± 3.3/m2 with membrane versus 8.0 ± 1.6/m2 without membrane. This new marine restoration measure showed to be effective on the reduction of the physical stress imposed by sediment reworking lugworms on Z. marina recovery, as a membrane keeps seeds at optimal depth for germination and protects seedlings from burial and erosion. In comparison to other measures, this new restoration technique is a low-tech nature-based solution. The results clearly show that this restoration technique can support Z. marina recovery through seeds and seedling protection. In this way, this technique contributes to decrease Z. marina vulnerability and increase its natural recovery potential and stability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

To do so, we employed the discourse analysis approach of Q methodology, where 33 researchers ranked 39 statements on ES derived from the literature. Factor analysis of the Q sorts allowed for the interpretation of five main perspectives on ES: a pragmatic view on nature conservation, seeing ES as useful tool (“Non-Economic Utilitarian”), a strongly value-focused perspective with a skeptical view on ES (“Critical Idealist”), an opposition to a utilitarian approach to nature conservation but seeing ES as more encompassing approach (“Anti-Utilitarian”), a focus on a methodological rather than a critical approach to ES (“Methodologist”), and a rather economic approach to environmental decision-making, in which ES is a useful tool (“Moderate Economist”). We see this plurality as illustrating both the potential of the ES concept to serve as a boundary object for collaboration, but also the threat of ineffective collaboration due to the lack of a common conceptual ground. However, as pluralism can be fruitful if handled transparently, we suggest the need for open dialogue about underlying assumptions when using a value-laden concept like ES. © 2017 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Nature-based approaches to flood risk management are increasing in popularity. Evidence for the effectiveness at the catchment scale of such spatially distributed upstream measures is inconclusive. However, it also remains an open question whether, under certain conditions, the individual impacts of a collection of flood mitigation interventions could combine to produce a detrimental effect on runoff response. A modelling framework is presented for evaluation of the impacts of hillslope and in-channel natural flood management interventions. It couples an existing semidistributed hydrological model with a new, spatially explicit, hydraulic channel network routing model. The model is applied to assess a potential flood mitigation scheme in an agricultural catchment in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom, comprising various configurations of a single variety of in-channel feature. The hydrological model is used to generate subsurface and surface fluxes for a flood event in 2012. The network routing model is then applied to evaluate the response to the addition of up to 59 features. Additional channel and floodplain storage of approximately 70,000\\xa0m3 is seen with a reduction of around 11% in peak discharge. Although this might be sufficient to reduce flooding in moderate events, it is inadequate to prevent flooding in the double-peaked storm of the magnitude that caused damage within the catchment in 2012. Some strategies using features specific to this catchment are suggested in order to improve the attenuation that could be achieved by applying a nature-based approach.

       " 'Environmental protection issues and the monitoring of pollution, especially for the largest cities in Asia, are becoming increasingly prominent factors for inclusive urban planning of public open spaces. Recently, a walkability concept was implemented in many cities, and in 2016 it became a campaign direction for development in Seoul. This paper considers conditions of implementation for the walkability concept, using examples of pedestrian walkway-making initiatives, and regeneration of existing walkways along water streams in urban case studies in Seoul, South Korea. The role of nature-based solutions was considered in relation to aesthetics, and social and environmental characteristics (e.g., air pollution, oxygenation through greenery) obtained through literature reviews for the case studies. Considering the complexity of the situation, with factors such as Air Quality Index (AQI) warning conditions, and the general positive impact of walkability on enhancing a healthy life style and social interaction and on reducing congestion, this study contributes to the discussion on walkability, and the importance of nature-based urban regeneration projects for densely populated areas in cities. The results of particular cases in this paper suggest the need for careful monitoring and consideration of various factors for urban regeneration walkable design projects. © 2017 by the authors.',\n",
